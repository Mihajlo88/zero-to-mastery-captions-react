00:00.390 --> 00:03.450
Welcome back everyone before we proceed.

00:03.480 --> 00:09.810
Let's just quickly walk through what it is that we just did so from a high level what we did was set

00:09.810 --> 00:11.360
up our node server.

00:11.580 --> 00:18.290
We're leveraging the library Express which makes it really easy for us to write a node back in server

00:18.860 --> 00:19.560
Express.

00:19.680 --> 00:25.890
Actually makes it super easy for us to leverage other libraries and make the process of writing this

00:25.890 --> 00:29.220
back and server really really simple.

00:29.280 --> 00:37.110
Beyond that what else we need to do now in the next step is actually set up our first route that allows

00:37.110 --> 00:40.070
us to actually make the stripe charge.

00:40.080 --> 00:47.100
Now the reason why we need to make a strike charge through our back end server is because the way that

00:47.100 --> 00:54.960
stripe is setup in order for the charge to be legitimate it needs to actually come with a secret key

00:55.410 --> 01:01.800
that we get from stripe that we need to send with our request to stripe in order to make our charge

01:02.280 --> 01:08.910
so that stripe knows that the charge is coming from our account the one that we set up whenever we look

01:08.910 --> 01:17.430
at our stripe dashboard once we have our actual stripe key being integrated into our back and then stripe

01:17.490 --> 01:20.640
is validly letting us actually make charges.

01:20.640 --> 01:27.780
We are not able to make a stripe charge from the front end because we cannot ever truly encrypt a secret

01:27.780 --> 01:29.560
key through the front end.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.910
It has to be done through a back end request.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.070
Now this is the main reason why we're doing this now.

01:36.150 --> 01:42.790
What we actually need to do is build that route that allows us to one receive a request from our front

01:42.810 --> 01:49.260
and application but then we actually need to take that request that our front end application is making

01:49.890 --> 01:53.790
and then pass it as a charge to stripe.

01:53.790 --> 01:55.170
So we'll figure out how to do that.

01:55.170 --> 02:01.620
In this lesson and then after that we'll actually have to link this striped button in order to create

02:01.620 --> 02:05.210
the request to the new route that we end up building in our server.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.410
Yes.

02:06.510 --> 02:11.820
Now the thing is that right now what we're doing is we're passing this on token method to our strike

02:11.820 --> 02:18.930
checkout which gives us back the token object which we actually need to pass to stripe through this

02:18.930 --> 02:24.900
back end route that we're making because that token is going to be the legitimate charge that we're

02:24.900 --> 02:25.980
trying to make.

02:25.980 --> 02:31.770
It has all of the information regarding the credit card information that the user put in the cost of

02:31.770 --> 02:38.130
the charge itself and any other miscellaneous data that stripe needs in order to process the charge

02:38.130 --> 02:40.130
that we're trying to make.

02:40.140 --> 02:45.690
So let's actually look at an image in what it is that we're trying to set up in the next few lessons.

02:45.750 --> 02:49.480
So here we have this picture in this picture.

02:49.490 --> 02:53.190
We have our client site application which is our crown clothing.

02:53.300 --> 02:56.360
We have our back end express server that we're building.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.210
And then here we have our stripe service.

02:59.660 --> 03:07.280
So this is going to be the actual API that stripe is hosting that we need to create a charge request

03:07.280 --> 03:08.410
to.

03:08.420 --> 03:15.020
So from our Express server what we're going to do is create that payment route and then from our client

03:15.020 --> 03:20.900
site application we are going to send a payment token to this payment route.

03:20.990 --> 03:27.140
Our payment route is then going to take that token use the stripe library to actually make a payment

03:27.140 --> 03:29.210
charge to stripe.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.150
So this is kind of what it is that we're trying to do.

03:32.150 --> 03:38.030
We have this back in section that is going to actually make the stripe charge but it's waiting for some

03:38.090 --> 03:44.930
client side application to make a request against this route and pass it some token that it can then

03:44.930 --> 03:47.900
use to actually create a stripe charge.

03:47.930 --> 03:51.400
So this is kind of the flow that you can see that we need to build.

03:51.410 --> 03:57.200
So we have the express server we have our client side application but we've got to build the code that

03:57.200 --> 03:58.970
actually will send the payment token.

03:59.030 --> 04:04.400
And we also have to build the code that will represent our payment route as well as the code that will

04:04.490 --> 04:10.900
end up making the payment charge itself to stripe so this image I want you to keep it as a mental model

04:10.900 --> 04:17.410
in your head about what it is that we're building next because with this mental model in mind we are

04:17.410 --> 04:24.730
going to set up this payment route and then setup the actual payment token request and this will have

04:24.730 --> 04:30.880
to do some code before we can actually see it work inside of our application and we'll begin by building

04:30.880 --> 04:33.070
out our payment route in the next less.
