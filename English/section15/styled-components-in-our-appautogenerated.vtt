WEBVTT

00:02.540 --> 00:09.950
So in order for us to start using stout components inside of our ReACT application what we need to do

00:10.310 --> 00:18.390
is first include the style components library inside of our application so we can just do that simply

00:18.390 --> 00:22.200
doing yarn ad styled dash components

00:24.800 --> 00:32.330
and once it installs we're going to talk about the naming structure as well as how we should structure

00:32.420 --> 00:34.840
are folders and files.

00:34.910 --> 00:42.950
Now that we're writing style components so let's start with a very basic component so that we can see

00:43.310 --> 00:51.080
what we need to do get familiar with the syntax before we move on to more complex components.

00:51.190 --> 00:55.020
And the first one I want to try is the home page component.

00:55.170 --> 01:05.100
So what we need to replace is this div with the class name home page with it's own home page stout component.

01:05.670 --> 01:13.770
So what we'll do is we'll make a new file called Home Page dot styles dot JSA X and we will import in

01:13.950 --> 01:25.810
style from Star components and we can name this div home page container and we'll use the same case

01:26.680 --> 01:34.700
of capitalizing because it is a component so we'll say home page container equals style dot div.

01:34.780 --> 01:36.000
As you remember right.

01:36.010 --> 01:41.980
Because we want to use a div where our call dot div to generate a new div and then we can literally

01:41.980 --> 01:52.340
just copy over the styles on our home page class selector and we can put them inside and then let's

01:52.340 --> 02:04.090
just export this out and now if we save and if we import in that component Home page book that's actually

02:04.930 --> 02:10.870
imported from home page lifestyles that J us and lets say home page container.

02:11.170 --> 02:18.090
We can now literally just replace this whole div with our home page container and then remove our style

02:18.090 --> 02:26.720
sheet and now if we look we see that our app is the exact same.

02:26.860 --> 02:36.100
In fact if we look inside and we look at our home page element we'll see that we have that unique string

02:36.700 --> 02:46.610
which is specific to our home page container component that we now just make so it's very simple and

02:46.610 --> 02:47.830
it's quite easy.

02:48.050 --> 02:55.230
And just like that is working now let's tackle a component that's a little bit more complicated.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.430
Let's tackle our header component

03:00.350 --> 03:00.690
now.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.170
Let's close that.

03:02.460 --> 03:08.910
Now if we look I had a component we'll see that there is the containing div that we need to make a header

03:08.910 --> 03:17.520
container right styled component for we need a logo container that will extend from link because we

03:17.520 --> 03:24.590
do need to leverage the link component from RAC writer Dom still and then we need actually the lower

03:24.590 --> 03:25.810
component and stay the same.

03:25.850 --> 03:33.230
We'll need this options container and we'll also need this options link but we'll also need the potential

03:33.260 --> 03:40.780
for our div with the class name option to also be a option link styling.

03:40.790 --> 03:40.970
Right.

03:40.970 --> 03:46.070
We need these styles to be shared between this link and this div.

03:46.160 --> 03:56.080
Now how do we do this well to start let's make our new header dot styles dot J.S. X while and then let's

03:56.140 --> 04:00.520
import in styled from styled components right.

04:00.520 --> 04:09.400
So let's tackle this one at a time we also want to can import in our link from RAC writer Dom because

04:09.400 --> 04:15.220
I'll show you how we can actually styled this link element using a stock component it's actually also

04:15.220 --> 04:20.310
very easy but the first thing that we want to do is just make the header container right.

04:20.320 --> 04:29.770
We just want to replace this header so we all say const header container equals styled

04:33.060 --> 04:38.920
and then let's just open up our header styles as well and copy this over

04:42.410 --> 04:51.970
so that's all the stuff that we need for our header container and then we also want our logo container

04:53.980 --> 04:57.930
so let's do our lower container as well.

04:58.030 --> 05:03.750
So we've got to export all these as well because we're going to import them later.

05:03.860 --> 05:08.800
We'll say low container which we know is now a link.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.780
So how do we use a link element.

05:10.780 --> 05:17.920
Well instead of calling dot and then the div we can do styled and then call it like a function and pass

05:17.920 --> 05:20.170
it the component that we wanted to wrap.

05:20.230 --> 05:24.720
And now we just continue with our string interpolation as we've been doing before.

05:24.850 --> 05:30.040
And now what we'll get is that is a style link component and it's just that easy.

05:30.100 --> 05:37.630
Just like that we've now extended style components into components which is what's super powerful about

05:37.630 --> 05:40.480
Star components and how easy it is to write.

05:40.510 --> 05:47.700
So for this one we just need our logo container code which is just this see us that's here and now our

05:47.700 --> 05:50.660
logo container is dot.

05:50.870 --> 05:58.360
Now the next thing we need is are options container which is this div right.

05:58.370 --> 06:06.560
So what we'll do here is we will say export concept options container which is equal to a style div

06:08.180 --> 06:16.390
and then let's just copy over options container code and we can just take this whole code right let's

06:16.390 --> 06:17.460
just take this one right here

06:22.470 --> 06:24.750
and then we have this option code.

06:24.780 --> 06:34.020
This option styling which is what gets applied to our option link and class name well because we want

06:34.320 --> 06:36.510
we don't want to duplicate our style.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.910
We want to write this more than once right.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.400
We want to be able to keep it in one place because our div and our link are going to share the classes

06:45.670 --> 06:46.750
or share the style sorry.

06:46.840 --> 06:52.110
Instead of using a class name we actually are able to leverage another thing that we get from store

06:52.120 --> 07:02.170
components called CSF and what this does it allows us to write a block of CSX that we can pass in and

07:02.170 --> 07:08.620
render as CSX inside of any of our stock components.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.050
And I'll show you how that looks.

07:10.180 --> 07:17.120
So we can say const option container styles and we just say CSX.

07:17.130 --> 07:17.480
Right.

07:17.550 --> 07:18.600
Because of that library.

07:18.970 --> 07:25.220
Well we just pulled in we apply these strings and now we just paste in the code that we want more than

07:25.220 --> 07:25.580
once.

07:25.610 --> 07:34.760
Which is this padding and cursor code and now if we wanted to replace these options we have two types

07:34.760 --> 07:35.370
of options.

07:35.390 --> 07:38.660
We have a little option link and an option div.

07:38.720 --> 07:39.590
Right.

07:39.680 --> 07:50.320
So we can literally say in our headers the export const option link right.

07:50.470 --> 08:00.360
And this will be a styled link and what we'll put in is just we'll use our string interpolation to render

08:00.420 --> 08:08.700
in this new options container styles code block of CSX that we wrote and we just do the same thing for

08:08.730 --> 08:14.000
our option diff and it's equal to a style div.

08:14.260 --> 08:22.160
And again we just interpolate in our option container style if you had a hard time following all we

08:22.160 --> 08:32.510
did was just instead of defining an h him a link or HDMI element for each of our elements we did the

08:32.510 --> 08:39.590
respective styled element and then if we wanted to use a custom component like say the length that we

08:39.590 --> 08:48.220
got from RAC rather Dom we can just call it into styled by passing it in and calling style like a function.

08:48.250 --> 08:54.760
Now if we want to share styles that might be duplicated all we have to do is import in this specific

08:54.760 --> 08:56.180
CSX keyword.

08:56.350 --> 09:02.950
And this allows us to now write CSX blocks that we can just include into our styles and we will get

09:03.010 --> 09:12.700
that CSX almost like a shared function so now that we have that let's import this all in and replace

09:12.760 --> 09:14.200
our respective code with it.

09:18.660 --> 09:31.690
So let's import in our head our container our logo container our options container our options

09:34.430 --> 09:36.590
give our option link

09:39.380 --> 09:43.280
and now we just replace the respective components

09:46.160 --> 09:55.290
so we'll just got to make sure to also get all the closing tags logo container during this class name

09:55.290 --> 09:56.130
property anymore.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.280
But remember to keep the two because it's still a link.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.840
So we need that functionality.

10:00.990 --> 10:02.480
We need our options container

10:08.150 --> 10:10.700
and then we need to replace our link with option link

10:16.920 --> 10:19.590
to replace this class name.

10:19.690 --> 10:23.760
In fact let's just delete this class name here as well.

10:24.800 --> 10:32.020
And then here instead of this div we need our option div also removing our class name.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.710
Don't accidentally remove the on click.

10:34.950 --> 10:38.540
And this final link will also be an option.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.070
Link

10:43.730 --> 10:47.690
now if we save I must have.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.440
Oh we have an unexpected div here.

10:50.440 --> 10:52.440
So this must be our options container

10:55.280 --> 11:02.320
got that one if we save we'll see our header is the exact same.

11:02.670 --> 11:05.590
So everything is working.

11:05.630 --> 11:15.290
That is how you pretty much style stock components so it's very simple and it's a lot of getting used

11:15.290 --> 11:24.350
to just the idea of converting all of your actual HDMI elements into their own style component but in

11:24.350 --> 11:31.010
a way now it makes a little bit more sense compared to this because before in order for us to see our

11:31.100 --> 11:31.850
options.

11:31.880 --> 11:32.280
Right.

11:32.300 --> 11:32.830
Which was right.

11:32.840 --> 11:41.710
That div we had to nest inside of our header to see what the options was but now instead it's easier

11:41.740 --> 11:46.650
because we are now able to just look at the options container.

11:46.660 --> 11:48.320
Oh this is an element right.

11:48.340 --> 11:52.860
We can just look at the styles related to this options container.

11:52.990 --> 11:55.570
We don't need to look at any other rules.

11:55.570 --> 11:56.680
Nothing in other rules.

11:56.680 --> 11:57.620
Right.

11:57.700 --> 12:03.520
We pretty much are now 100 percent sure that the code related to our options container is just in its

12:03.640 --> 12:05.620
own component.

12:05.680 --> 12:12.280
So this is really powerful and it's a great amount of leverage that we get as javascript developers

12:12.460 --> 12:19.270
and we'll continue converting some components over and we'll see more of where it's so useful in some

12:19.270 --> 12:25.400
of the perhaps more challenging components that we've had so I'm going to end this video because it's

12:25.400 --> 12:30.230
getting a little long but in the next video we'll continue converting our components over.
