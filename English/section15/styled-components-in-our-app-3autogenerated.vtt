00:00.910 --> 00:07.840
So now that we've converted over our header component let's tackle something more challenging because

00:07.960 --> 00:14.980
all we've done with this header component and the homepage component is convert some pretty basic CSX

00:15.070 --> 00:21.060
over into a stock component but what about using the props that we were talking about.

00:21.270 --> 00:28.740
Well one of our biggest components that actually does that is our custom button component by using CSX

00:28.980 --> 00:33.390
and these props that we get in to custom button.

00:33.390 --> 00:37.710
We actually have three possible states right.

00:37.710 --> 00:45.990
Three possible CSX styles that we might apply on our button but this is actually pretty much exactly

00:45.990 --> 00:51.870
what styled components is meant to do what we're trying to do here with class names we can actually

00:51.930 --> 00:54.780
easily do with style components.

00:55.050 --> 00:58.120
Now how do we do this.

00:58.150 --> 01:03.570
Well let's make a new file called custom button dot styles Dot.

01:03.580 --> 01:16.050
Jessica and inside we want to import in styled and we also want CSF from stock components and we want

01:16.050 --> 01:21.050
to assess because we will be pretty much modifying the base component right.

01:21.070 --> 01:24.340
We're not going to conditionally render different components.

01:24.340 --> 01:28.470
We just want our stock component to have different styles in it.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.490
And we can easily do that with a CSX block.

01:32.810 --> 01:38.060
So instead of conditionally running class names we can conditionally render CSX blocks related to what

01:38.060 --> 01:40.100
the styles are nested in those class names

01:42.940 --> 01:52.920
so if we open up our style sheet as well we see that these styles are related to our custom button.

01:52.920 --> 01:59.030
These styles are related to the Google sign and these styles are related to the inverted right.

01:59.070 --> 02:09.560
So what we can do is we can separate these three chunks into their own styles or stock component.

02:09.560 --> 02:18.040
So what we'll do first is we will create our base style which is our base component which should be

02:18.040 --> 02:28.120
our custom button container which is equal to a styled button and in the stop button we are going to

02:28.120 --> 02:30.780
just put all of these styles that we know that we want

02:37.770 --> 02:43.740
and the great thing is that it's just supports pretty much the exact same syntax as we wrote with our

02:43.740 --> 02:44.160
SAS.

02:44.160 --> 02:44.620
Right.

02:44.660 --> 02:48.810
As we get all the benefits of SAS but we also get the benefits of JavaScript

02:52.070 --> 02:58.280
what we want to do is we also want to create these separate styles that we had for our Google sign in

02:58.610 --> 03:00.780
and our inverted button style.

03:01.040 --> 03:11.630
What we want to do is we can make a new concept called inverted button styles which is equal to a CSX

03:11.660 --> 03:22.410
block that holds the code to our inverted button styled so we'll just copy this.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.560
We also need our Google sign and styles

03:30.120 --> 03:36.060
which is also equal to a CSX block and we're just going to copy over our Google sign and styles

03:39.290 --> 03:47.090
and now what we need to do is instead of rendering just these thousand while we know that we can write

03:47.090 --> 03:48.500
JavaScript.

03:48.500 --> 03:48.770
Right.

03:48.770 --> 03:57.640
So what we can actually write is a function that we call inside of this component because it's just

03:57.670 --> 03:58.590
all javascript.

03:58.960 --> 04:08.150
So what we can write is can't get buttons styles is equal to a function that gets the props and what

04:08.150 --> 04:11.890
it returns is different styles depending on what we have.

04:11.920 --> 04:22.680
So we can say if props dot Google sign in which is the same props that we had from here right.

04:22.680 --> 04:26.410
We'll still just pass them in then.

04:26.450 --> 04:32.320
I want to return Google site and styles out of this function.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.590
So I want to return these styles.

04:33.610 --> 04:42.710
If the Google sign and property's true otherwise what we want to return if is prop star inverted if

04:42.710 --> 04:48.250
this is true then return inverted button stuff.

04:49.750 --> 04:55.980
Otherwise what we want to return is nothing or our base styles.

04:55.990 --> 05:02.380
So what we can actually do in fact is we can even make this a step further because now we can leverage

05:02.380 --> 05:02.780
this.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.810
What we will move out is the styles that are conflicting with our inverted button stuff so we can say

05:07.810 --> 05:16.020
concert buttons styles is equal to the CSF of our regular background right.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.880
What our background is black.

05:17.880 --> 05:21.030
So let's just pull that off.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.050
You know that when our background is black and our color is white

05:28.360 --> 05:35.170
we know when the color is white actually the color white is also in our Google stores.

05:35.180 --> 05:42.430
But that's OK we'll copy over our color is white and then we also want when our border is not

05:46.520 --> 05:49.770
and then on the hover.

05:50.010 --> 05:55.670
We also want our hover.

05:55.750 --> 06:01.970
Now what we'll do is if we don't return invert a button stores where we're just return buttons.

06:02.580 --> 06:08.620
So what we did is we pretty much wrote this function that checks first if you have Google sign in if

06:08.670 --> 06:09.770
it's Google sign and we don't.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.190
We know it's never gonna be inverted.

06:11.190 --> 06:12.070
Right.

06:12.090 --> 06:17.250
So then we never want to hit this part where we can return any of these styles we want to return our

06:17.250 --> 06:23.130
Google sign and style and then if this is not true if Google sign it is false then we check if it's

06:23.130 --> 06:23.730
inverted.

06:23.730 --> 06:26.430
If it's inverted then we return the inverted button styles.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.280
If it's not inverted then we returned the regular buttons that and then in order to use this we just

06:34.280 --> 06:38.090
call this inside of our component like so

06:41.450 --> 06:50.110
and just like that instead of writing all of that nested ugly looking ternary operators for our class

06:50.110 --> 07:01.270
names we can just now import in our button.

07:01.480 --> 07:08.530
We don't even need to spread in all of these other props like so we can just spread in all of our props.

07:08.710 --> 07:09.250
Right.

07:09.370 --> 07:12.370
Because our class name or sorry not our class name.

07:12.700 --> 07:18.160
Instead of doing it like this we don't even need to be structure anything anymore because we don't need

07:18.160 --> 07:22.950
that kind of specificity because we're not doing it in this file.

07:22.950 --> 07:26.150
We can now just spread in our props

07:29.360 --> 07:31.720
we do need to do structure off the children though.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.970
So let's this

07:38.590 --> 07:43.190
just like that we've reduced the amount of complexity and what we see here.

07:43.480 --> 07:48.250
And now if we want to know what styles get loaded we can tell because all we can just look at this function

07:48.280 --> 07:48.510
right.

07:48.520 --> 07:51.400
We see that we have some base styles on this button.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.720
And then what other styles get rendered is depending on what props we got passed in.

07:56.110 --> 08:04.240
And it's very easy to see what will get because each piece of code is now inside of its own section

08:04.450 --> 08:06.240
and it just reads like Javascript.

08:06.610 --> 08:12.820
But except we know that we're getting CSA styling and now if we look we'll see all our buttons still

08:12.820 --> 08:16.830
work the same way that they did before.

08:16.850 --> 08:24.160
Well I think I might have misspelled our Google sign just check what we're using.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.790
This is in our sign and

08:28.870 --> 08:30.300
oh is Google sign it.

08:30.340 --> 08:34.800
What's the Google's.

08:35.010 --> 08:40.200
Now if we save right we see everything still works the same as it did.

08:40.260 --> 08:44.730
So hopefully you see the benefits of using style components does already.

08:44.730 --> 08:45.150
Right.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.370
It's just more javascript.

08:47.370 --> 08:52.800
It's just easier to write JavaScript but it's not like we're giving up our understanding of CSX.

08:52.800 --> 08:59.070
All we're doing is just writing the javascript and following the javascript rules that we're already

08:59.070 --> 08:59.970
so used to.

09:00.390 --> 09:04.050
So now let's just remove this custom styles because we don't need anymore

09:07.340 --> 09:14.810
so hopefully you're familiar with what it is to move over some of our style sheets over to our S as

09:14.810 --> 09:18.350
in jazz style components at this point.

09:18.350 --> 09:26.240
What you can do is you have all of these other components that you can convert over to style components

09:27.590 --> 09:31.430
if you find that you're hitting a challenging area.

09:31.430 --> 09:39.470
I have included a link to the complete version where every component that we've ever written is switched

09:39.500 --> 09:48.690
over to a star component so you can just use and leverage that if you would prefer otherwise in the

09:48.690 --> 09:49.610
next few lessons.

09:49.620 --> 09:55.080
We're going to move on from style components because the concepts are pretty much just the same as what

09:55.080 --> 09:57.190
you've seen here.

09:57.200 --> 10:03.860
Now one of the things to consider is definitely that you don't have to convert all of these components

10:03.860 --> 10:04.810
at once.

10:05.030 --> 10:08.250
If you want to break from some of the future lessons right.

10:08.330 --> 10:15.020
If you feel like something is overwhelming it's actually kind of therapeutic to convert styles over

10:15.020 --> 10:21.240
to stores stock components and the more practice you get the better it'll be.

10:21.260 --> 10:26.720
I do think one last thing we have to do is remove our reference to the styles that SAS inside of our

10:26.720 --> 10:31.910
custom button component but going back to my original point.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.120
There's many ways.

10:33.120 --> 10:33.320
Right.

10:33.330 --> 10:35.420
And there's many ways you can learn.

10:35.550 --> 10:39.540
You don't have to just copy everything over right.

10:39.540 --> 10:45.030
You don't have to force yourself until you hit a wall before you check the final repo where everything

10:45.030 --> 10:47.720
is converted over to a stock component.

10:47.850 --> 10:54.120
You can definitely just use it as a reference if you even want to just look at what you have.

10:54.150 --> 10:56.310
Look at the final version right.

10:56.310 --> 11:00.160
Compare and even just copy it over OK.

11:00.370 --> 11:02.050
Now let's continue with our course.
