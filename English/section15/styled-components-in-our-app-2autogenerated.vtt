One caveat that I want to point out when we look at our option land component and our option div component

00:10.040 --> 00:17.450
one of the great things about using the CSA as Block was that if we needed to ever change the appearance

00:17.600 --> 00:26.150
of our links in our header and we were rendering different types of base HDMI components such as here

00:26.150 --> 00:26.980
how we're using a link.

00:27.020 --> 00:36.710
And here we're using div we're able to easily modify the styles in one place versus if we had written

00:36.710 --> 00:39.680
this inside of each component respectively.

00:39.680 --> 00:44.550
Like so then we would have to modify them.

00:44.630 --> 00:50.980
So for example if we needed to change the padding we would have to manually change it here to 15 and

00:51.040 --> 01:00.100
also reflectively change it in the option div whereas by using these optional container style CSF blocks

01:00.400 --> 01:03.850
we can change it here and have those changes reflected everywhere right.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.620
So that's a great usage in the C Ss block style which I wanted to us to learn.

01:09.430 --> 01:16.480
But there's actually another way to make it even easier if the only difference between these two style

01:16.480 --> 01:21.610
components is what type of base element it needs to return.

01:22.920 --> 01:30.270
So what we can actually use instead of doing it like this and using the C Ss block is inside of the

01:30.270 --> 01:37.400
component itself if option Lincoln option div are say the same and we just want this option linked but

01:37.400 --> 01:46.120
as a div we can actually literally change it by using the as property and then passing in the string

01:46.210 --> 01:53.080
of the element we want and you can even also pass a component like so if you pass it in like this.

01:53.170 --> 02:00.140
If you wanted to use say any of our regular components that we've written before but instead I want

02:00.140 --> 02:09.640
it div so I'll pass it as a string and now I'm able to see that our sign up button which is the component

02:09.640 --> 02:13.510
we just replace is still a div.

02:13.510 --> 02:18.850
So that's what's really cool is that by just doing this we're actually now able to reduce the amount

02:18.850 --> 02:20.990
of code that we've written.

02:21.130 --> 02:25.080
So now we can remove the CSX remove this.

02:25.410 --> 02:33.190
Actually let's copy over these styles first right because now we can remove this we can remove the option

02:33.190 --> 02:40.990
div component and now we can just paste in these styles we can remove our option div import

02:43.660 --> 02:48.900
and we're no longer importing link as well inside of this component because all of our components are

02:48.900 --> 02:51.420
now in the styles folder.

02:51.420 --> 02:57.540
So now we'll see that we've reduced the amount of overhead we have in the amount of code we had earlier

02:58.380 --> 03:04.470
while also keeping sure that our header is the same so I just want to point out that that's actually

03:04.590 --> 03:07.470
a really cool little thing we can also use.

03:07.560 --> 03:12.840
So we're just trying to explore as many of the tools that style components gives us and how much flexibility

03:12.840 --> 03:14.430
we have within this paradigm.

03:16.380 --> 03:16.790
OK.

03:16.890 --> 03:22.200
Now let's continue converting our application over using style components.
