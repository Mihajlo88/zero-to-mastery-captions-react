WEBVTT

00:01.090 --> 00:08.870
Okay everyone let's continue with modifying our application to be more mobile responsive.

00:09.130 --> 00:16.080
So the next thing I want to update is our header component so our header right now is not optimized

00:16.080 --> 00:17.960
for the mobile view.

00:18.030 --> 00:25.410
So inside of our hairstyles I'm just going to modify the actual width and height to be a little bit

00:25.680 --> 00:34.110
more aligned with the actual browser view inside of a mobile device now inside of this header container.

00:34.110 --> 00:41.540
We are going to just paste in that same media query that we had before because we're using the same

00:41.540 --> 00:45.830
media query in any of our mobile style changes.

00:46.490 --> 00:53.660
So here what I'm going to do is I'm going to write it so that what I want to set in terms of the actual

00:53.660 --> 01:00.260
header container is I want to shrink the height to 60 pixels instead of 70 pixels just literally shaving

01:00.260 --> 01:01.770
off 10 pixels here.

01:02.030 --> 01:08.180
I want to make sure that there's some padding all around the header of 10 pixels and then I'm going

01:08.180 --> 01:17.480
to have a margin bottom of 20 pixels so that we push the content down with our new header.

01:17.490 --> 01:24.690
So with that we need to now modify the actual size of the components inside of the header but the header

01:24.690 --> 01:32.080
is shaped more like how I want it to be now inside of the actual logo container.

01:32.100 --> 01:39.870
I am going to add in this media query again and what I want to change is I want the width of this logo

01:39.870 --> 01:46.980
to be way smaller so I only want it to be fit 50 pixels and then I don't want any padding anymore.

01:46.980 --> 01:50.460
I just want a padding of zero.

01:50.460 --> 01:57.990
So now if we go back and we see we see that our logo is more aligned with where we want it to be inside

01:58.080 --> 02:04.270
of this header Now I also want to make sure that the options container.

02:04.290 --> 02:09.980
So that section containing the option links we have that navigate us to different web pages.

02:10.080 --> 02:16.140
I want to make sure that that is now taking up more of the space of the header than before before it

02:16.140 --> 02:21.450
only took up 50 percent of the total width of the header because with so much real estate space with

02:21.480 --> 02:30.330
a web view instead I'm going to do a width of 80 percent because the only other thing on this browser

02:30.330 --> 02:35.340
page when we're in this mobile view or in any view in fact is just the logo.

02:35.820 --> 02:42.630
So now with this with set this way we have way more space as we can see in fact everything still works

02:43.260 --> 02:45.210
which is really great for us.

02:45.210 --> 02:50.980
We just need to make sure to update our views like our home page to also be responsive.

02:51.120 --> 02:57.590
Now what it is that I want to change is I want the menu item to fit in a nicer way.

02:57.630 --> 03:07.880
So what we can do is go into our menu item styles and modify them so that they have a similar media

03:07.910 --> 03:15.180
query and then render a different shape on the actual menu item container.

03:15.200 --> 03:22.790
So as you remember we set the height based on this size property which does dictate to it how big it

03:22.790 --> 03:26.570
should be based on which image it is.

03:26.570 --> 03:32.210
Because when you remember inside of our web view the men and women sections are larger than the three

03:32.270 --> 03:35.160
other sections that we have now.

03:35.470 --> 03:42.610
What we want to do here is we want to actually modify this height value so that it stays pretty consistent

03:42.820 --> 03:43.930
regardless of size.

03:44.710 --> 03:51.500
So what we can do is at the end append our media screen query and we'll just say is simply height 200

03:51.580 --> 04:00.560
pixels now media queries have a higher specificity than anything else inside of our styles.

04:00.560 --> 04:08.750
So no matter what styles inside of this here the media query if it has the same style will always over

04:08.780 --> 04:16.040
write the styles here because media queries always have a higher specificity order than regular selectors.

04:16.040 --> 04:23.870
So now if we go back we'll see that our elements are aligned much better because the heights are statically

04:23.870 --> 04:31.370
200 pixels and the width will always adjust so the screen will try and fit these elements on the page

04:32.240 --> 04:34.750
in the right order that they have access to.

04:35.570 --> 04:39.800
And then the moment that a new one starts on a new page it fills the remaining space but the height

04:39.830 --> 04:44.030
is always set to a specific static two hundred pixels.

04:44.030 --> 04:50.970
So with that we now have a mobile view now our home page is set up.

04:51.060 --> 04:58.790
The next thing that we need to modify is our shop page our shop page is going to be a little bit more

04:58.790 --> 05:03.500
complicated because our shop page it doesn't look terrible.

05:03.530 --> 05:10.530
We have these elements but the problem with this is that this item you have to actually click it in

05:10.530 --> 05:15.750
order to see the add to cart which you'd then have to click instead with a mobile view.

05:15.750 --> 05:22.770
This button seems too small in order to just put here the style and the actual design needs it to be

05:22.800 --> 05:29.130
a little bit more deliberate in how we can actually add items because we want our users to be able to

05:29.130 --> 05:31.800
add items as easily as possible.

05:31.800 --> 05:41.440
So what we're going to modify is both the collection preview as well as are actual collection item.

05:41.490 --> 05:49.820
So let's go back to our application code and what we need to do is go to the collection items styles.

05:49.860 --> 05:55.420
Now I do think actually I have a slight typo in our collection item here.

05:55.440 --> 06:03.540
I accidentally put collection styles dot styles but A6 this should actually be a collection item.

06:03.540 --> 06:10.960
Dot styles such as so if we make that modification we also have to make sure that we update it here.

06:11.140 --> 06:17.290
Now mine automatically updated it for me because my vest code is intelligent like that.

06:17.290 --> 06:22.090
If yours is not you just gotta make sure to modify the place where you imported all of these stock components

06:22.150 --> 06:22.650
in.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.950
So that is pointing to the right route.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.630
Just a little typo.

06:26.650 --> 06:26.880
Right.

06:26.890 --> 06:28.590
These things happen to everybody.

06:28.960 --> 06:35.650
So inside of our collection items styles what we're going to do is we are going to go into this collection

06:35.680 --> 06:46.840
item container and we are going to modify how large this width will be based on the actual mobile view

06:47.620 --> 06:54.520
so inside of here I want the width to be 40 view with meaning that it takes up 40 percent of the total

06:54.550 --> 06:57.310
width of the full view.

06:57.310 --> 07:03.160
Then I need to overwrite some of these hover features because these hover features I don't want inside

07:03.160 --> 07:05.760
of my mobile view with our mobile view.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.210
I don't care about the hover.

07:07.330 --> 07:11.600
You don't actually hover that much with touch as you're used to with the mobile.

07:12.160 --> 07:19.120
So what I'm gonna say is that the image just unset the opacity unset pretty much says that this was

07:19.180 --> 07:20.550
never set in the first place.

07:20.580 --> 07:26.920
So there's actually no image styles here on the hover effect of the image.

07:26.940 --> 07:34.600
When you're inside of this medium sized for any buttons in here I also want to unset the opacity as

07:34.600 --> 07:35.180
well.

07:37.000 --> 07:44.250
So now if we go back to our application we'll see that we're looking at the wrong file.

07:44.250 --> 07:51.900
This is probably because we didn't save this file so once my vest code actually updated this route it

07:51.910 --> 07:56.670
didn't actually manually save the file for me so I had to manually make that save.

07:56.670 --> 08:02.190
And now here we'll see this looks a little bit more tightly coupled because the width is larger.

08:02.190 --> 08:09.180
The only reason it's still stacking like this is because we need to update our actual collection preview

08:09.180 --> 08:10.080
view.

08:10.260 --> 08:18.670
So what we'll do here is we will go to our collections preview styles and inside of the preview container

08:19.210 --> 08:24.030
we need to write our media query so let's copy back our old media query here.

08:26.660 --> 08:40.590
And inside we are going to say that I want this now to have a line items property so this allows us

08:40.590 --> 08:49.530
to have everything centered when ever our content is inside of this display flex.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.280
Now I know that this is a lot of CSX that we haven't touched upon before.

08:53.310 --> 08:56.890
If you're unfamiliar with CSX this might be completely new to you.

08:57.840 --> 09:03.490
Honestly this CSX is pretty extensive in terms of what rules there are.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.920
I'm going to link the Flex box ruling documentation for you.

09:06.930 --> 09:12.090
It's actually an amazing resource to read through because it's really a matter of where the more you

09:12.090 --> 09:18.060
practice it the more that you'll see it's really comprehensive and it's difficult for me to cover inside

09:18.060 --> 09:23.130
of a course on react because I'll have to spend so much time on actual CSX things.

09:23.130 --> 09:29.820
So if this gets confusing for you at any point I will definitely include a version of our application

09:29.820 --> 09:32.820
where everything is converted to be mobile friendly for you.

09:33.060 --> 09:37.670
Otherwise you can pause the video and read up on some of these styling rules.

09:37.680 --> 09:44.190
If my explanations are not fully clear and you don't have the full context of everything but it's really

09:44.190 --> 09:49.170
just a matter of doing this assess on your own with practice right.

09:51.290 --> 09:56.810
So one of the other things that we have to do after we did this a line items is we need to modify our

09:56.810 --> 10:06.100
preview container as well so that instead of being a display flex what it will be is a display grid.

10:06.120 --> 10:12.290
Now this is a new CSX feature that I will also link the documentation for and this is another version

10:12.380 --> 10:13.750
of display flex.

10:13.970 --> 10:19.190
We've actually used display grid before inside of our application and it literally just lets us place

10:19.310 --> 10:27.110
elements inside of whatever this top level component is in a grid like shape so here.

10:27.170 --> 10:33.530
I'm gonna say grid template is always going to just have columns where it's one F R one that far if

10:33.530 --> 10:37.340
you remember from that lesson on CSX grids really quickly.

10:37.450 --> 10:44.900
One half hour just means whatever space is remaining inside of this screen meaning that there will always

10:44.900 --> 10:52.490
be essentially columns and the two columns here will each take up one full portion of the application

10:52.520 --> 10:58.280
which means that they are equally 50 percent of what space is available inside of this preview container.

10:59.240 --> 11:08.210
And then I also want a grid gap of 15 pixels so grid gap is pretty much just the spacing between these

11:08.240 --> 11:09.310
elements.

11:09.320 --> 11:15.840
So with this now we see that our application looks more like that grid I was telling you about right.

11:15.910 --> 11:24.050
There's always two columns and they always take up one f r of space they're also 40 of you with in size

11:24.080 --> 11:29.340
and there's a 15 pixel gap in between all of these items.

11:29.350 --> 11:34.760
So now our application looks way closer to what we need it to be.

11:34.910 --> 11:38.300
Now the only thing missing is our actual button.

11:38.360 --> 11:44.120
So what we're going to do is we're gonna go back to our collection item styles and we're going to modify

11:44.120 --> 11:53.150
the button itself so that the button is always displayed whenever we're in a mobile view we're gonna

11:53.150 --> 11:56.170
say that the display is block instead of display none.

11:56.180 --> 11:59.690
So block is the default you can do blocker inline block.

11:59.930 --> 12:04.440
We're going to make sure that the opacity is zero point nine.

12:04.490 --> 12:08.610
We're also going to set a mean with value where we unset it.

12:08.630 --> 12:13.130
The reason why we have to unset it even though it's not here is because the button leverages custom

12:13.130 --> 12:18.710
button and custom button is a custom button container with a min width of one hundred and sixty five

12:18.710 --> 12:21.390
pixel but that's too big for mobile view.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.010
That's pretty much half our screen.

12:23.090 --> 12:29.780
So we just want to unset it and we also want to modify the padding so that what it will do is it'll

12:29.780 --> 12:38.970
set a top value of 0 10 pixels on the right zero on the bottom and then 10 pixels on the left so this

12:38.970 --> 12:42.180
way we're getting 0 10 pixels 0 10 pixels.

12:42.210 --> 12:47.760
In fact you don't even need this this syntax is also the same way if you just put two values for patting

12:48.030 --> 12:50.640
it saying 0 for top bottom 10 pixels left right.

12:51.290 --> 12:57.200
And now if we save this we'll actually see that our button is always present.

12:57.480 --> 13:00.220
If we click this we'll see that it still works.

13:00.330 --> 13:06.480
Our items are being added to our checkout our collection preview is pretty close to what we actually

13:06.480 --> 13:07.260
wanted to look like

13:10.070 --> 13:10.280
now.

13:10.310 --> 13:15.710
At this point I definitely encourage you to take a crack at trying to modify the styles for the rest

13:15.710 --> 13:16.490
of this yourself.

13:17.060 --> 13:22.880
It's a good exercise to maybe work on some CSF that we haven't really touched upon too much of in this

13:22.880 --> 13:30.420
course because this is a react course once you've played around with the styles you can always check

13:30.420 --> 13:33.540
back to the get hub for what it is that we have done.

13:33.700 --> 13:39.270
Now I will also include a get hub link of everything we've done up until this point right now so you

13:39.270 --> 13:44.240
have something to reference against but just like with all the other exercises that we did.

13:44.310 --> 13:50.010
This is a great chance to take some time of your own to play around with some styling.

13:50.090 --> 13:56.450
So good luck with that and always refer to the completed version and see how your styles match up to

13:56.450 --> 13:57.150
mine.

13:57.350 --> 14:01.000
Again mine is just my own attempt at the solution right.

14:01.010 --> 14:05.540
It's totally up to you how you want your application to look in a mobile view.

14:05.690 --> 14:06.830
So with that.

14:06.950 --> 14:09.790
Good luck with the exercise and I'll see you in the next lesson.
