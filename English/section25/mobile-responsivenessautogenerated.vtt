WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:03.180
Welcome back everybody.

00:03.240 --> 00:10.560
So in the last few sections I know we didn't work off of our main application because we were mostly

00:10.620 --> 00:18.540
implementing in different features that couldn't challenge the existing solutions of reactor redux inside

00:18.600 --> 00:25.620
of our main commerce platform by testing out context API and then switching over to graph fuel in Apollo

00:25.620 --> 00:26.580
client.

00:26.580 --> 00:33.390
So it's actually been a while since we've worked on our main application but now that we finished those

00:33.390 --> 00:39.780
tangential sections where we've really deeply explored other alternatives to the reactor redux architecture

00:39.810 --> 00:47.820
that we already currently have it's time we come back and start rounding out our application with the

00:47.820 --> 00:52.730
last 20 percent that gives our application that extra room.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.380
Now these things might not actually be any features at all.

00:56.580 --> 01:03.570
In fact in the upcoming sections we are going to round out your skill set as a web developer so that

01:03.570 --> 01:10.560
you understand that last kind of mysterious part of what it takes to build an application effectively

01:11.130 --> 01:13.600
and have it be performance.

01:13.650 --> 01:20.640
So one of the first things that I want to talk about is actually making our website mobile friendly.

01:20.850 --> 01:24.140
Now currently our Web site is not mobile friendly.

01:24.210 --> 01:30.600
It is a little bit responsive but it's not fully optimized for the mobile viewing experience.

01:30.630 --> 01:39.210
So what we're going to do is actually modify the CFS in our files to show that they are more aligned

01:39.210 --> 01:42.450
with how we would want it to look on a mobile browser.

01:42.450 --> 01:46.230
And I'm gonna show you that by using media queries.

01:46.230 --> 01:51.330
Now before we actually dive into the code of writing our media queries one of the main things we have

01:51.330 --> 01:57.600
to think about is actually how do we make sure that we can view our application inside of a mobile environment.

01:57.900 --> 02:04.080
If you're rolling chrome it's actually extremely easy to do so the Chrome browser allows us to just

02:04.140 --> 02:11.980
open up the dev tools and click this little tablet looking icon inside at the top of that toolbar which

02:11.980 --> 02:14.190
says toggle device toolbar.

02:14.190 --> 02:22.290
If you click this you'll actually see your mobile web view be your main view now where your browser

02:22.290 --> 02:24.010
was before.

02:24.210 --> 02:30.990
You can adjust the size of this and in the top number here you'll see the actual width and height of

02:30.990 --> 02:31.980
your new view.

02:31.980 --> 02:35.150
So this pretty much simulates a mobile view.

02:35.220 --> 02:42.090
So this is the main way that we are going to use it to see what it is that we are actually going to

02:42.180 --> 02:50.810
have as the mobile version of our web application now that we have this we are going to start leveraging

02:50.810 --> 02:55.100
these media queries to modify our code to be more mobile friendly.

02:55.280 --> 03:01.980
So let's go back to our application one of the first things that we need to do is actually change this

03:01.980 --> 03:06.330
final app dot CSX file over to style components.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.620
Now the way that we import of the style sheet is perfectly fine right.

03:09.630 --> 03:16.170
It's just one app dot CSA style sheet that doesn't necessarily have to change when we moved over to

03:16.170 --> 03:20.320
CSX and J.S. but for consistency sake we might as well do it.

03:20.370 --> 03:26.600
And it's really easy in order to implement global styles all we have to do is use this new function

03:26.600 --> 03:28.530
called creates global styles.

03:28.790 --> 03:34.490
So in order for us to do that we're going to make a new folder that will hold the component that represents

03:34.610 --> 03:36.160
our global styles.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.120
So we'll write this new file and we'll call it global.

03:39.120 --> 03:49.820
Dot styles dot J.S. now inside of here we are going to import in from the styled components library.

03:50.140 --> 03:53.080
This thing called create global style.

03:53.170 --> 04:02.290
So with this we can actually create this new concept called Global style which is equal to us using

04:02.710 --> 04:09.700
this Craig global stop and then we pass it r tilde version of our string right because we want string

04:09.700 --> 04:16.510
interpolation and now all we do is we just put all the styles that we had inside of our indexed SPSS

04:17.080 --> 04:23.350
inside of here if we really wanted to we could even do it with our index ISIS as well.

04:23.540 --> 04:27.840
But this is inside of our index Yes and it's not 100 percent necessary right.

04:27.890 --> 04:35.030
Let's just do it with our abducts the USS so once we placed the new stores inside of this global stop

04:35.540 --> 04:41.670
we'll make sure to export this out and all we need to do in order to bring it into our application is

04:41.670 --> 04:45.590
literally load it at the top level of our app.

04:45.640 --> 04:53.410
So what we'll do is we will go back to our app J.S. will remove this import that we had before and in

04:53.410 --> 04:57.310
its place we will import in our global styles.

04:57.310 --> 05:06.940
So let's actually move this header up here and say import global style from our new global styles file

05:08.750 --> 05:15.890
and now it's literally just a component that we can put above the header like so and this will apply

05:15.920 --> 05:18.980
those styles into our application.

05:18.980 --> 05:24.320
So if we go back to our application and we search our view back we'll see that our global style and

05:24.320 --> 05:25.720
our padding is still there.

05:25.730 --> 05:32.390
In fact if we inspect this we see we still have our party and our body still has the painting code that

05:32.390 --> 05:34.070
we had from our global star XI.

05:34.850 --> 05:40.730
So it's really convenient to do it this way because now we are pretty consistent with the way that we're

05:40.730 --> 05:42.300
writing our code.

05:42.470 --> 05:46.330
In fact now we can get rid of this app to see us as far because we don't need it anymore.

05:46.490 --> 05:52.660
And we can start leveraging these media queries so the first thing I want to do is I want to reduce

05:52.660 --> 05:57.880
the padding on this mobile view of our application.

05:58.000 --> 05:58.810
So how do I do that.

05:59.620 --> 06:03.340
Well I keep talking my media queries so I'm going to show you what it actually looks like when we write

06:03.340 --> 06:04.240
them.

06:04.360 --> 06:10.670
You put the media query inside of the CSF selector that you want to modify.

06:11.230 --> 06:16.450
So if we have style components we just make sure to put this media query inside of that style component

06:16.480 --> 06:25.040
as well and the way that a media query looks is it takes the format of this at media and here what we'll

06:25.040 --> 06:32.470
say is scream and and then inside of here we put certain properties that tell it.

06:32.690 --> 06:40.380
At what point do we want this style block to be applied.

06:40.510 --> 06:45.360
Now here you can set things like Min with Max with or just one or the other.

06:45.390 --> 06:51.120
And all this is saying is pretty much I only want you to render the C S S block here.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.460
That will put inside of here.

06:52.500 --> 06:56.160
So wherever here it is we'll say there's some CSF inside of here.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.080
Right.

06:57.120 --> 07:03.150
We only want this to render based on the rules that we write inside of these brackets.

07:03.150 --> 07:12.140
So in my case I'm gonna say max width is eight hundred pixel meaning that any thing below a hundred

07:12.440 --> 07:16.190
and below in terms of the width will get these styles.

07:16.490 --> 07:21.550
Anything above a hundred pixels will not get these things.

07:21.650 --> 07:29.030
So our body styles will be applied but then these media screen max width of eight hundred pixels this

07:29.030 --> 07:35.480
block of CSF that we're about to write is going to be applied as long as the window's width does not

07:35.540 --> 07:43.080
exceed eight hundred pixels so here I want to set the palette to 10 pixels all around instead of what

07:43.080 --> 07:49.110
we had before where our padding was 20 pixels top bottom 40 pixels on the left and right now if we save

07:49.110 --> 07:53.220
when we go back we see that our padding has shrunk.

07:53.220 --> 08:01.750
Now we only have a 10 pixel border padding around the body so that is our immediate query.

08:01.790 --> 08:05.510
Now I'll link a resource for you guys to see other media queries that you can write because there's

08:05.510 --> 08:06.290
so many.

08:06.290 --> 08:06.530
Right.

08:06.530 --> 08:12.230
This is literally just the pixel not that I chose to dictate because I find with iPhones there pixel

08:12.260 --> 08:16.550
count based on the new retinas is a little bit challenging.

08:16.550 --> 08:21.700
So that sometimes the amount of pixels that you think you might be might be a little higher.

08:21.800 --> 08:25.880
I find that most browsers do not have a with smaller than hundred pixels.

08:26.150 --> 08:33.200
And if it's a tablet it's perfectly fine if it responds the same way as we would see for a mobile device

08:33.230 --> 08:36.690
if it was inside of a portrait view.

08:36.740 --> 08:43.280
So I find a hundred pixels to be one that I'm comfortable with now of course you can dictate and set

08:43.280 --> 08:45.070
them to whatever else you want.

08:45.200 --> 08:51.020
Resources that I've linked for you have multiple breakpoints that are also always changing as the technology

08:51.020 --> 08:54.560
for phones gets better screen resolutions get larger.

08:54.560 --> 09:01.010
It's literally just completely dictated by whatever you and your team decide to do.

09:01.010 --> 09:07.070
I personally like this a hundred pixel rule for my max with for a project like this where mobile views

09:07.070 --> 09:09.350
are not big it's the most important thing to me.

09:10.070 --> 09:14.660
But I do want my screen to be responsive and I want my application to be responsive.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.060
And it's really just that simple.

09:17.120 --> 09:23.010
We have this media query for our mobile view of 800 pixels right or below.

09:23.240 --> 09:28.010
And then we just make sure to modify the padding or whatever other properties we want to set differently

09:28.400 --> 09:29.920
or also add now.

09:29.950 --> 09:30.240
Right.

09:30.260 --> 09:35.560
So that our screen responds the right way when it's in this mobile view.

09:35.570 --> 09:42.350
Now I'm going to go around and modify a couple more components in the next lesson but then I do want

09:42.350 --> 09:47.420
you guys to try it yourself and tinker around with it because this is a great chance for you to kind

09:47.420 --> 09:50.500
of see and play around with some of the CSF.

09:50.930 --> 09:58.210
So you can have it look a way that you want in the end it's really just a matter of taste with styling

09:58.850 --> 10:03.800
but I'm gonna show you what I'll do for some of these components that I think we'll end up looking nice

10:04.580 --> 10:10.880
so you can either proceed yourself with trying to convert some of these styles yourself first you can

10:10.880 --> 10:12.700
watch the next video and then do it.

10:12.710 --> 10:18.800
After that it's entirely up to you but this section is purely on making our Web site responsive.

10:18.800 --> 10:21.370
So with that I will see you in the next lesson.
