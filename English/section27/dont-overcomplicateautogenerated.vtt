Hey it's Andre here.

00:03.260 --> 00:10.180
I want to talk about an important principle which is this idea of not over complicating things so far

00:10.180 --> 00:10.770
in the course.

00:10.780 --> 00:17.700
We learned a ton and there are so many more things so many libraries so many tools that we can use.

00:18.250 --> 00:26.860
And it's very very easy to start using perhaps the latest react features the latest coolest library

00:27.100 --> 00:31.420
keep adding all these tools and trying to make your code look impressive.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.040
But that comes at a cost.

00:36.100 --> 00:41.950
Remember when you're working on a team when you're working with others when you're working on big projects.

00:41.950 --> 00:48.510
How many lines of code you write isn't indicative of how good of a developer you are.

00:48.520 --> 00:56.740
I argue that the less code you write the better it is because every line of code means you need to test

00:56.740 --> 00:57.700
that code.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.410
It could be buggy code.

00:59.410 --> 01:02.730
It's a code that somebody has to read to maintain it.

01:02.770 --> 01:08.860
So you want to make sure that when you write code you're not doing things just to look impressive just

01:08.860 --> 01:10.180
to be clever.

01:10.180 --> 01:14.440
What you want to do is to keep things simple.

01:14.510 --> 01:17.180
Do you think that react hooks is confusing.

01:17.180 --> 01:17.610
Good.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.100
Then don't use them.

01:19.100 --> 01:28.130
Use class syntax because good code isn't about what's the latest and what's the trend trendiest good

01:28.130 --> 01:33.220
code is about writing really predictable clean understandable code.

01:34.010 --> 01:36.420
And senior developers understand this.

01:36.650 --> 01:45.550
The cleaner your code the simpler it is the better it's going to do in the long term so remember next

01:45.550 --> 01:54.310
time you want to implement graph Q Well of react to Router react hooks context API styled components

01:54.820 --> 02:00.670
just for your simple to do app that's when you need to stop and reconsider.

02:00.670 --> 02:04.960
Hey don't overcomplicate keep things simple.
