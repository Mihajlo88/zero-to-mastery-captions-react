00:01.260 --> 00:02.950
This is a big one.

00:03.060 --> 00:11.850
This one I hold dear to my heart and it's the idea that things will never be perfect no matter how hard

00:11.850 --> 00:17.760
you study no matter how many videos you watch how many books you read how many projects you built your

00:17.760 --> 00:20.490
code is never going to be perfect.

00:20.580 --> 00:26.550
A lot of people hold off on shipping a product or building something because they think they still need

00:26.550 --> 00:32.200
to improve something they still need to learn or they still need to add that feature at a buck.

00:32.370 --> 00:36.600
But the problem is that this is a continuous cycle.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.460
It's never going to be perfect.

00:38.490 --> 00:43.380
Things are always evolving and there's always going to be different ways that you can refactor code

00:44.390 --> 00:48.770
make things maybe more efficient cleaner looking.

00:48.780 --> 00:54.210
The problem is when you have this mentality of oh I'm gonna have to wait until it's absolutely perfect

00:54.840 --> 00:59.290
is that you end up just bottling all this productivity inside you.

00:59.490 --> 01:06.720
But until you put out your work until you do something in the real world to solve a problem everything

01:06.720 --> 01:09.870
is internal all that code that you write.

01:09.880 --> 01:14.600
If nobody sees it if nobody uses it it might as well just not be there.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.160
So keep that in mind.

01:17.380 --> 01:23.800
It's better to just start doing something start putting something out there start releasing that product

01:24.460 --> 01:26.910
because no matter why you do it won't be perfect.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.320
What you want to do is constantly improve.

01:29.770 --> 01:34.630
And the best way to improve is to get feedback on your code from other people feedback on your product

01:35.940 --> 01:40.040
so I guess what I'm saying is stop watching these videos.

01:40.230 --> 01:47.100
Close your laptop well don't close your laptop where programmers but close this video open up your code

01:47.100 --> 01:50.460
editor and start writing your project.
