Hey there.

00:01.770 --> 00:08.400
It's time for another lesson and the lesson in this video is to be a late follower.

00:08.400 --> 00:14.410
What do I mean react is a tool that's constantly evolving.

00:14.410 --> 00:17.800
No program no software no library is ever perfect.

00:18.250 --> 00:27.000
So the community is constantly improving it right now reacts version is sixteen point eight but by the

00:27.000 --> 00:32.910
time you watch this video most likely it's going to be higher and higher because it's constantly improving.

00:32.910 --> 00:36.780
You have things like react hooks that were recently added.

00:36.870 --> 00:45.420
We're gonna have suspense concurrency mode and react there things like react fire react fiber.

00:45.470 --> 00:52.150
A lot of planned updates that are coming and sometimes it can be overwhelming to keep up with everything

00:53.050 --> 00:54.180
and this is my advice to you.

00:57.220 --> 01:03.220
Usually what happens when something gets announced is that people get really really excited and they

01:03.220 --> 01:06.100
start using it right away in their project.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.440
The problem is that sometimes developers don't get it right the first time.

01:11.510 --> 01:15.350
It takes some time to develop best practices.

01:15.350 --> 01:22.750
Sometimes maybe the API isn't good enough so they decide to change some things because of this.

01:22.790 --> 01:30.440
When you're looking at react for your project you want to make sure that you do things that aren't going

01:30.440 --> 01:31.040
to change.

01:31.220 --> 01:33.580
Ideally your project can last a long time.

01:34.670 --> 01:40.640
If you're adding the latest features what's going to happen is most likely a year down the road road

01:40.910 --> 01:44.100
somebody realizes that there's a better way of doing it.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.670
So take your time.

01:46.670 --> 01:53.150
If something's new learn about it get excited about it but be cautious that just assuming that it's

01:53.150 --> 01:56.100
the best way to do something is not always the case.

01:56.150 --> 02:04.560
Usually you want to give it a bit of time somewhere around a year until the community settles on best

02:04.620 --> 02:06.240
practices.

02:06.270 --> 02:08.910
If you were at the beginning when react got started.

02:09.090 --> 02:13.680
I remember people were doing things that well just doesn't exist anymore.

02:13.680 --> 02:17.800
People were building components in ways that actually doesn't exist anymore.

02:17.850 --> 02:23.120
So all those people had to update their code base because of these changes that were coming.

02:23.130 --> 02:30.620
I remember working at a company in Silicon Valley and we implemented the latest version of react to

02:30.630 --> 02:35.720
router and unfortunately it was not well documented because it was so new.

02:35.820 --> 02:42.090
So we had to spend a really really long time waiting for the API to settle before we had a working product

02:42.090 --> 02:46.020
because we chose to do something that well was at the very cutting edge.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.440
So be a late follower.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.110
You don't want to be the first one to try out something.

02:52.830 --> 02:55.800
Sometimes it's good to be behind the early adopters.
