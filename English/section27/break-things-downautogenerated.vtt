This advice works not just with react but in programming in general.

00:07.920 --> 00:10.570
And right here I say trim the fat.

00:10.680 --> 00:18.570
But what I really mean is that breaking down things into small simple units is a good way of programming.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.260
You have a giant component with a lot of sex.

00:22.350 --> 00:22.840
Good.

00:22.890 --> 00:28.190
Then most likely why you want to do is break that into smaller components.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.420
Sure it might be more JavaScript files you might say.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.280
Oh that's gonna get a little too messy.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.470
Too many JavaScript files.

00:34.500 --> 00:41.470
Well then I argue that perhaps you should organize your files in a better system because although Yeah

00:41.530 --> 00:45.400
we might have more JavaScript files we'll have more components.

00:45.400 --> 00:52.750
What we do by breaking things down is that we make things easier to test easier to understand and less

00:52.750 --> 00:59.710
likely to break right if things are just small units that just concern themselves with one specific

00:59.710 --> 01:02.450
thing they're less likely to break.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.750
They're also easier for people to understand.

01:04.750 --> 01:08.880
They open up a file and you have 30 lines of code that's easy to read.

01:08.890 --> 01:13.370
Then a giant component that you have to go line by line to figure out what's happening.

01:13.600 --> 01:20.570
So ninety nine percent of the time if you think that component can be broken down into smaller components.

01:20.740 --> 01:27.990
Yeah go ahead and do it although it just may generate more files a code in the end.

01:28.030 --> 01:35.690
As projects get larger and larger the idea of having reusable components becomes more and more important.

01:35.770 --> 01:37.690
So trim the fat people.
