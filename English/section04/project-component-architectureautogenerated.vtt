Hey it's Andre here.

00:02.010 --> 00:07.650
I want to talk quickly about architecting our components in our final project.

00:07.650 --> 00:13.350
If you remember one of the key things that we want to do is to decide on components.

00:13.350 --> 00:19.370
So as we move through the course I want you to always have a mental image of what we're building in

00:19.370 --> 00:21.260
and how things are connected.

00:21.510 --> 00:28.170
Because how things are connected and how we pass down information from component to component because

00:28.200 --> 00:32.730
at the end of the day it's all a tree like structure of the virtual Don.

00:32.850 --> 00:34.740
That's really really important.

00:34.740 --> 00:39.910
So make sure you don't get lost as we move through different components back and forth.

00:39.930 --> 00:45.430
Now here's my tip for you to better understand how things are connected what you want to do.

00:45.690 --> 00:50.820
And I have a version of the Web site here that will actually go into built so there are some things

00:50.820 --> 00:52.890
here that you probably won't have yet.

00:53.070 --> 01:02.000
But what do you want to do is to open up your developer tools and use the react developer tools.

01:02.220 --> 01:07.290
Now in here this is a good way to see how components are connected.

01:07.290 --> 01:13.020
For example if I scroll all the way up and keep in mind that you'll see components here that we haven't

01:13.020 --> 01:14.120
talked about yet.

01:14.430 --> 01:18.260
But the key thing is that we have our app component.

01:18.430 --> 01:19.470
We have our header.

01:19.480 --> 01:23.240
So if we scroll up we see that we're going to build a header component.

01:23.380 --> 01:30.690
If we keep scrolling down we see we have our home page and then if we keep scrolling down we have our

01:30.690 --> 01:35.750
directory which is the items that we have on our home page.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.470
And then within the directories we have what we call the menu items and then menu item component as

01:43.470 --> 01:48.070
you can see is these individual components that we can link to.

01:48.300 --> 01:55.740
And each time we can see what prompts we receive from higher above like directory for example and so

01:55.740 --> 02:02.500
on and so forth so you want to use the reactive helper tools to understand how things are connected

02:02.620 --> 02:05.260
if within your code you start getting confused.

02:05.260 --> 02:13.480
Keep in mind the reason that we organize our folders the way they are is so that it's easy for us to

02:13.480 --> 02:15.830
look at our app and understand how things are working.

02:15.850 --> 02:21.970
For example right now we know that we have pages and at the moment we only have one page which is the

02:21.970 --> 02:22.460
homepage.

02:22.510 --> 02:25.500
But eventually we'll build the shop page as well.

02:25.870 --> 02:30.520
If we go back and look at the our components we have some components here that we haven't built yet

02:31.060 --> 02:35.470
but we have the directory which is our home page and then the menu items that we saw.

02:35.470 --> 02:39.680
We're also going to start building our collection preview and collection items.

02:40.090 --> 02:44.380
And those ones are going to be what we call these things.

02:44.380 --> 02:56.850
These again if I inspect them and open up react you'll see that this is a collection item so these are

02:56.850 --> 02:58.610
our collections and these are the items.

02:58.610 --> 03:05.940
If I scroll up I see that this entire thing gets surrounded in the collection component.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.790
So again I can go back to the folder and understand that.

03:08.810 --> 03:09.100
OK.

03:09.110 --> 03:15.800
This is the collection item and the collection preview is probably what we're building to display the

03:16.070 --> 03:18.880
collection items that groups the collection items.

03:18.950 --> 03:25.400
So start looking at the folder structures and understand how things are connected because eventually

03:25.400 --> 03:28.690
by the end of this course we're gonna have a lot of things.

03:28.730 --> 03:36.380
If we look at the components folder yep we have a lot of components and it's easy to get lost in all

03:36.380 --> 03:44.280
this component connections but again that's why reactive all power tool exists and it's also what makes

03:44.280 --> 03:50.490
a great developer you need to make sure that as we move along that these component structures make sense

03:50.490 --> 03:58.590
to you and you notice the small things that EU does to keep things very simple and small in each component

03:58.650 --> 04:04.770
and keeping each one specific to its concern doing one thing really really well.

04:05.980 --> 04:06.460
Let's move on.
