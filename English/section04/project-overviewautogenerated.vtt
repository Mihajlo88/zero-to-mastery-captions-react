00:00.270 --> 00:03.320
This is our final e commerce project.

00:03.390 --> 00:11.230
We're gonna have navigation and routing that takes us to different pages of categories of items and

00:11.230 --> 00:18.380
from these items we're actually going to be able to add them to our cart and from our car.

00:18.400 --> 00:26.000
We're actually going to see these things directly update and from this car we're gonna be able to checkout

00:26.750 --> 00:33.920
increase or decrease these items again and see the live changes in both our checkout page and our car

00:33.920 --> 00:42.990
page remove items and actually integrate with a stripe API so that we can handle payments.

00:43.060 --> 00:49.360
Now this is actually going to be a test version of Stripe because we don't actually have items to ship

00:49.390 --> 00:56.350
and we don't actually want to process real payments because this is just a portfolio project but the

00:56.350 --> 01:02.070
matter of switching it is simply a change in the actual stripe website.

01:02.220 --> 01:09.390
You're going gonna actually learn what it is to actually build using the stripe API and beyond that.

01:09.390 --> 01:15.930
We're also going to integrate with firebase to handle our authentication and our storage.

01:15.930 --> 01:22.530
So with firebase we're actually going to be able to authorize our users using Google so that we can

01:22.530 --> 01:33.780
sign in with our Google accounts and once we sign in we're also going to provide a sign feature and

01:34.050 --> 01:37.050
a sign up and sign in with email and password feature.

01:37.110 --> 01:44.670
So it's gonna be a really fleshed out fully complete e-commerce platform just like you would build for

01:44.670 --> 01:46.170
real e-commerce company.
