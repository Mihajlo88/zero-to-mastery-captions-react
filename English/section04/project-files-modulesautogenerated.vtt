00:00.820 --> 00:02.020
Hey it's Andre here.

00:02.170 --> 00:07.690
Before we move on I want to make sure that we understand some of the files and also what we did in the

00:07.690 --> 00:13.570
previous video with some conflicts that we had especially installing notes says what really happened

00:13.570 --> 00:14.350
there.

00:14.560 --> 00:21.850
First off when we start a project we always have a node modules folder that comes built in with create

00:21.860 --> 00:22.800
reactor.

00:22.840 --> 00:30.670
Now this node module folder is quite massive as you can see we have a ton of packages.

00:30.670 --> 00:36.720
These are all the libraries that create react app uses underneath the hood.

00:36.950 --> 00:38.920
Remember the react scripts.

00:39.070 --> 00:46.690
If we go all the way down to package Doug Jason you see that we have all these dependencies but all

00:46.690 --> 00:56.140
of them are using the script star J.S. like so now e who are uses yarn versus what I use which is NPM

00:57.180 --> 01:02.730
and you see over here that we have different versions instead of our yarn log file for example have

01:02.730 --> 01:10.980
the package log file so why you use is up to you the key thing to remember is that node modules contains

01:11.220 --> 01:17.010
not only all the libraries that we're going to install throughout the course but also libraries that

01:17.400 --> 01:23.670
create react app uses underneath the hood like the just package which allows us to do some testing.

01:23.880 --> 01:28.300
Now the thing is all these packages seems like a lot.

01:28.470 --> 01:35.670
And what Cory react app tries to do is to create an IDC like environment that is it allows us to do

01:35.670 --> 01:37.940
testing lending and all these things.

01:38.100 --> 01:44.910
And most of these packages are only used during development when we actually ship our code and we build

01:45.030 --> 01:45.750
our code.

01:45.750 --> 01:51.900
Most of these packages won't make it through only the code that is absolutely needed for the app and

01:51.900 --> 01:55.220
not for development are going to be included in this bill.

01:55.230 --> 02:01.800
So some people complain that you know modules folder is way too big but at the end of the day it's big

02:01.800 --> 02:08.260
because create react app tries to make our environment for developing apps pleasant.

02:08.280 --> 02:16.500
Now the issue that we saw with node sass happened because of this package just but let's talk about

02:16.500 --> 02:22.230
that a little bit more because as you develop apps as you work with react you're going to encounter

02:22.260 --> 02:28.260
this issues of dependency and dependency management between libraries is a big problem.

02:28.270 --> 02:28.620
So

02:32.180 --> 02:41.390
react since version 2.0 comes with SAS support which we saw all we had to do was install notes SAS using

02:41.390 --> 02:42.530
NPM or Yahoo.

02:42.710 --> 02:49.060
And we're able to use SAS files so that create react app takes our SAS files convert them into C Ss

02:49.070 --> 02:50.570
into that built folder.

02:50.870 --> 02:58.100
But what happened when we installed this the air that you saw with e Hwa is something that you'll encounter

02:58.310 --> 02:59.230
as you work with react.

02:59.480 --> 03:06.630
So I'm going to show you how to better understand the issue see the first thing I would do if I encounter

03:06.630 --> 03:12.480
a problem like that is I would google for it for example note SAS error with create racked up Babel

03:12.540 --> 03:15.350
just conflict which was what the error we got.

03:15.600 --> 03:22.170
And if I go to the second link here which says react scripts Babel just version conflict which sounds

03:22.170 --> 03:27.150
like the conflict that we're having and right over here as we expected.

03:27.360 --> 03:32.670
It's an open issue with create react out where react scripts Babel just version is complex.

03:33.540 --> 03:38.880
And as a developer you want to start getting good at finding these issues and going to get hybrid repositories

03:38.910 --> 03:41.600
and see if anybody else has had this issue with you.

03:41.820 --> 03:48.700
And it looks like this person had pretty much the same issue that we saw so the beauty is that you can

03:48.700 --> 03:55.060
actually read through this and understand why the issue is happening how you can fix it and what other

03:55.060 --> 04:03.280
people have done if you actually scroll all the way down you can see that this issue should be resolved

04:03.950 --> 04:09.460
when this is released so we click over here and we see that.

04:09.580 --> 04:17.290
Yep create react app just merged on May 7th which isn't that far off from when I'm recording this video.

04:17.420 --> 04:20.210
A fix for this so that this issue doesn't happen.

04:20.210 --> 04:24.140
So most likely by the time you're watching this video you won't encounter this.

04:24.140 --> 04:30.350
But I want you to start thinking in terms of if you encounter an issue most likely somebody else has

04:30.350 --> 04:30.720
had it.

04:30.830 --> 04:38.030
So Google it around and usually in a project like create react app you'll find open issues.

04:38.120 --> 04:43.130
You have three hundred and three issues open right now and eighty five pull requests.

04:43.130 --> 04:45.230
So you want to start getting good at that.

04:45.230 --> 04:51.630
Now another thing I want to talk about is this package lock file.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.240
If you're using your yarn.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.580
It'll be a yarn log file.

04:55.680 --> 05:00.690
This is used because our project most likely won't run on our computer.

05:00.690 --> 05:01.850
Most likely we're going to.

05:01.860 --> 05:05.200
Once we're done with the project we're going to send it off to a server somewhere.

05:05.250 --> 05:11.820
So that project runs on a different computer when a user opens the app on a browser.

05:11.820 --> 05:13.330
It runs on their computer.

05:13.500 --> 05:21.790
So our code although when we code along is in our own environment on our own laptop in real life.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.860
When people actually use your app they won't be using it from your computer.

05:25.910 --> 05:26.180
Right.

05:26.450 --> 05:34.550
So package lock files allow us to have consistent installs across machines so that all these dependencies

05:34.970 --> 05:40.450
have the exact version number that they need in order for everything to work.

05:40.460 --> 05:42.350
It's like everything is intertwined.

05:42.350 --> 05:50.930
This file is what we use or at least what create react app use so it knows exactly what dependencies

05:50.960 --> 05:53.360
and what thing works with what.

05:53.450 --> 06:01.600
Just like we have Babel just that was needed for both notes apps as well as for that create react app

06:01.640 --> 06:04.630
because both of them use it to test their code.

06:04.730 --> 06:10.730
Now in a couple of videos we'll actually see how EA who are solves this problem another way using something

06:10.730 --> 06:13.600
called the resolution property.

06:13.610 --> 06:16.140
And this is something that's only specific to yours.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.060
So if you have NPM that isn't available for you.

06:20.150 --> 06:23.510
But again that's just something that you most likely won't encounter.

06:23.510 --> 06:30.450
But we wanted to show you anyway remember you can always read more about these things at the Web sites

06:30.630 --> 06:31.560
documentation.

06:31.560 --> 06:35.340
You want to start getting really really good at debugging your own code.

06:35.340 --> 06:41.510
Finally the last file I want to talk about is this file that we just removed which was service worker.

06:41.510 --> 06:49.370
Now this comes pre-built with create reactor and it's mainly used for what we call progressive web apps.

06:49.370 --> 06:51.880
And we're going to talk about that later on in the course.

06:51.950 --> 06:57.570
Service worker file allows us to make our app what we call progressive again.

06:57.620 --> 07:02.360
For now we don't need to worry about this but I do want to let you know that we are going to come back

07:02.360 --> 07:08.470
to it and talk about what service worker is doing because it has some really neat features.

07:08.520 --> 07:09.080
All right.

07:09.080 --> 07:09.920
That's it for now.

07:10.010 --> 07:10.940
After the next video.
