Ladies and gentlemen we've come to an important crossroad in our path to becoming a great reactive helper.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.330
You see we have two options here.

00:12.370 --> 00:15.820
The first option is we can keep going.

00:15.820 --> 00:24.310
We can keep learning react syntax small little tricks and pretty much learned the entire documentation

00:24.790 --> 00:31.990
which is right over here so that like a dictionary we understand every single thing about react.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.300
Every single tool in the library.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.000
But here's the thing you can do that on your own.

00:38.050 --> 00:41.780
You don't need me to tell you what the documentation sets.

00:41.860 --> 00:45.420
And as a developer you should learn how to read the documentation.

00:46.150 --> 00:52.710
However I do understand that sometimes it's nice to have somebody show you how things work how maybe

00:52.750 --> 00:59.540
something that isn't clear online is explained so we're going to take a different strategy than most

00:59.540 --> 01:02.080
courses here and I've talked about this before.

01:02.180 --> 01:07.240
What we're going to do is we're going to try and simulate a real work environment.

01:07.430 --> 01:08.790
What does that mean.

01:08.810 --> 01:14.840
Well moving forward we're gonna start off building our e-commerce Web site.

01:14.840 --> 01:22.050
We're going to build a full out online clothing shop from start all the way to finish where we put it

01:22.050 --> 01:22.920
online.

01:22.920 --> 01:25.240
It's going to allow us to do a ton of things.

01:25.530 --> 01:32.130
But what we want to mimic here is how in a real life scenario you would most likely be working with

01:32.130 --> 01:40.330
somebody perhaps a senior developer so along the way I'm going to ask you to code along have your code

01:40.330 --> 01:42.470
side by side next to the videos.

01:42.580 --> 01:48.190
As we work through the project together and as we build the project we're going to encounter different

01:48.190 --> 01:54.220
problems different things that perhaps we haven't learned yet and react and slowly we're gonna learn

01:54.220 --> 02:01.330
these things as we build the project because we could spend the next 20 hours just building five more

02:01.450 --> 02:06.790
useless projects that aren't impressive because there are things they can do in a day.

02:06.790 --> 02:12.970
What impresses employers and what gives you actual work experience is building these large projects

02:12.970 --> 02:14.610
from start to finish.

02:14.770 --> 02:16.990
So we're going to choose this path.

02:16.990 --> 02:24.280
So if you feel like hey I feel like I only know maybe 40 percent of react then that's OK because we

02:24.280 --> 02:31.190
have a long way to go I hope that you stick around because by the end of this course that 40 percent

02:31.190 --> 02:37.970
of knowledge is going to grow and we're going to try and build something from scratch so that at the

02:37.970 --> 02:45.470
end of the day you don't just learn a list of tools but you learn how to lead projects how to explain

02:45.470 --> 02:51.500
to people how react works how to decide on good architecture it's time to get started.
