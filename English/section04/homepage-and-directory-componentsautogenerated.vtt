WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:06.010
OK now let's start moving our components into their own folders.

00:06.080 --> 00:11.760
So the first thing I'm gonna show you is actually our new folder structure.

00:11.960 --> 00:18.020
So we're actually going to have two folders one of four components which is going to hold all of our

00:18.020 --> 00:22.850
reusable components and one for our page components.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.820
So what's a page.

00:24.860 --> 00:29.570
Well when you think about our home page it's also a component but it's a component that we're probably

00:29.570 --> 00:31.680
not going to use more than once.

00:31.700 --> 00:34.160
So any page that we make.

00:34.160 --> 00:38.830
I'm going to make a new component folder for it inside of our pages.

00:38.840 --> 00:47.270
Separate it from our reusable components so let's begin with our home page component and we're gonna

00:47.280 --> 00:55.760
do component touch s x and we're gonna move our code here into our home page.

00:57.030 --> 01:02.310
And then we're also going to copy our styles and we're just going to move this into our home page as

01:02.310 --> 01:02.570
well

01:05.750 --> 01:07.350
now.

01:07.570 --> 01:15.160
We don't need this anymore and we have to update our app dot j ust to point to the new location of our

01:15.160 --> 01:23.800
home page component so it's two pages home page combat combat.

01:23.990 --> 01:31.740
If we save and if we make sure to save this as well if we go back to our app we should see everything

01:31.740 --> 01:34.640
is the same OK.

01:34.860 --> 01:43.290
Now let's start moving our directory and our menu item into their own components so let's first start

01:43.290 --> 01:52.640
with our menu item component so let's make a menu item folder in our components folder and then make

01:52.640 --> 01:56.770
a menu item dock component dodgy OSX.

01:56.790 --> 01:59.870
Now we're also going to need those menu item styles.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.970
So let's make a menu item.

02:01.980 --> 02:11.070
Dot styles dot SAS file as well let's copy over our menu item styles into our menu item styles that

02:11.080 --> 02:21.570
CSF and then in our US let's import react from react and far menu item.

02:21.710 --> 02:27.200
We're going to use a functional component because we don't really need our component to hold any state

02:27.320 --> 02:28.160
at least not for now.

02:28.340 --> 02:38.390
So let's start with a functional component so let's do menu item equals a function that returns to us

02:38.510 --> 02:40.150
what we had in our home page component.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.100
So let's just copy this over

02:50.270 --> 02:58.430
we probably want to be able to dynamically generate title by passing a title into our menu component.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.170
Right as a props.

03:00.170 --> 03:09.590
So instead of doing something like props title like this we might also need some other properties to

03:09.590 --> 03:16.630
be passed in if we look at our application we're gonna see that each one of these has a different image.

03:16.670 --> 03:17.590
Right.

03:17.630 --> 03:28.100
So what we can do is we can actually de structure the title off of our props for now and then we can

03:28.550 --> 03:36.020
just populate our component with that D structure value of title from our props.

03:36.020 --> 03:42.350
This is the exact same thing as writing props that title except we're pulling that title value off of

03:42.350 --> 03:49.370
our props and then setting it to this title value inside of our function so we can use it whenever we

03:49.370 --> 03:49.700
want.

03:50.790 --> 04:02.770
And then let's export out our menu item and now we have our menu items now let's make our directory

04:02.770 --> 04:13.290
component so let's make a directory folder and inside we will make our directory dot component dot Jess

04:13.300 --> 04:22.850
X and just like earlier we'll also need a style sheet for this directory DOS styles dot s so let's copy

04:22.850 --> 04:28.520
over our home page styles for our directory now because we've got the menu item we don't need this anymore

04:29.530 --> 04:38.830
so let's just get rid of it but let's copy over our directory menu code into our directory s and then

04:40.410 --> 04:42.710
let's import react from.

04:42.780 --> 04:53.340
React and this one will need to be a class component because we do need to store the state value of

04:53.340 --> 04:58.860
those menu items that we want to pass and create our menu items with.

04:58.890 --> 04:59.510
Right.

04:59.550 --> 05:04.950
So just like when we did our monster's Rolodex and we had that card list component.

05:04.950 --> 05:12.380
This one is going to have a directory with a state value of those menu items.

05:12.420 --> 05:22.920
So let's make a class of directory that extends Reactor Component and remember earlier the first time

05:22.950 --> 05:27.450
we were actually importing it as a regular import from react.

05:27.480 --> 05:34.490
But this component class actually also exists on the react namespace that we import from react.

05:34.500 --> 05:38.010
So we don't even need to do an additional import.

05:38.010 --> 05:45.560
We can just do react on component so inside of our directory class we need that constructor right.

05:45.580 --> 05:52.410
We always need our constructor and inside of our constructor we need to call super so that we pull in

05:52.470 --> 05:56.220
all the things we need from our ReACT component into our class.

05:56.220 --> 06:04.690
And then we're going to set our state value right now because we're populating menu items.

06:04.920 --> 06:09.510
Each of these menu items is kind of like a section right.

06:09.570 --> 06:17.060
So I'm actually just going to call it section and that's gonna be an array value that I have here for

06:17.060 --> 06:27.010
you in a different file and what it is is it's just an array of objects that have a title and an image

06:27.010 --> 06:33.910
euro and the image you are always going to point to an image that stored somewhere else online for these

06:34.120 --> 06:46.620
images so inside of our render we want to return what we had in our home page.

06:46.770 --> 06:52.950
So let's go back to our homepage and let's copy this directory menu because that's all we really need

06:55.310 --> 07:02.620
and now we want to map through our sections.

07:02.620 --> 07:13.190
Right and we want to pass these section objects into our menu item so that you can create the menu items.

07:13.530 --> 07:22.440
But let's also import our menu item component from our menu item component folder

07:25.540 --> 07:30.960
and now we know that we have to pass in a function to our map call.

07:31.060 --> 07:32.110
Right.

07:32.170 --> 07:40.180
So in our map call of our array we're gonna get a section and what we want to render is the menu item

07:43.440 --> 07:47.090
so there are many ways we can pass the props in right.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.100
We can just.

07:48.150 --> 07:50.190
We know that we want a title right.

07:50.190 --> 07:58.050
So if we wanted to pass the title we could easily just do section title but what we want to do is be

07:58.050 --> 07:58.310
cut.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.050
We know we need this value.

08:00.060 --> 08:00.970
This title value.

08:00.990 --> 08:04.790
We know we need the image URL and we want the ideas for our key as well.

08:04.790 --> 08:13.360
Right what we can do instead of doing this which we have a type section every time we can actually D

08:13.360 --> 08:17.020
structure all these values off of our section.

08:17.020 --> 08:25.460
So we're going to get the title we're gonna get the image URL and we're gonna get the idea and now we

08:25.460 --> 08:26.480
can just do this

08:29.270 --> 08:41.080
and now we have our ideas and our title going in to our menu item so let's make sure to export our Directory

08:44.060 --> 08:44.540
OK.

08:44.580 --> 08:49.440
And then we got to make sure also to bring our style sheet in.

08:49.510 --> 08:51.850
So I think I didn't do that for our menu item either.

08:52.360 --> 09:03.020
So let's do that as well for our menu item and then we got to go into our home page and replace our

09:03.110 --> 09:10.680
old code with our new components so let's go and import in our directory

09:13.180 --> 09:14.010
from

09:16.740 --> 09:29.100
our components folder our directory directory component and now we can replace all of this with just

09:29.250 --> 09:31.050
our directory

09:34.810 --> 09:40.440
and if we go back we should see that everything is the same awesome.

09:40.710 --> 09:45.870
OK now what about our images.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.610
Well you remember in our directory we had that image euro.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.800
So let's just pass that also into our menu item

09:57.510 --> 10:05.170
so we're gonna pass this image URL value into our menu item and then in our menu item component we are

10:05.230 --> 10:07.820
going to actually do something different.

10:08.230 --> 10:18.410
So react actually gives every one of these HDMI Mel markup elements another property called style and

10:18.410 --> 10:28.010
style takes an object that has prop values equal to C Ss values you want to apply to this element.

10:28.010 --> 10:33.100
So what we want to do is we want to set a background image right.

10:33.290 --> 10:39.290
And these CSF values instead of being the kabob case that we're used to seeing here right with the dashes

10:39.770 --> 10:49.100
is going to be in camel case and we want to set it equal to the image you are L that we just passed

10:49.190 --> 10:52.280
into this component from our directory.

10:52.280 --> 10:57.170
What we got do in order to make this work and see RSS which is we have to actually pass it as you are.

10:57.230 --> 11:02.780
L With the string interpolated value of image row.

11:02.980 --> 11:12.910
And this is really awesome because this allows us to dynamically make styles on our components which

11:12.910 --> 11:18.610
is super convenient because if we want it if this image were all changed right our CSF value changes

11:18.610 --> 11:19.420
as well.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.550
And that's really cool.

11:21.550 --> 11:26.990
So we just have to update another style in our actual style sheet regarding what this background image

11:27.000 --> 11:28.100
URL is going to be.

11:28.120 --> 11:28.350
Right.

11:28.360 --> 11:35.020
So we always want our image you are ls to have that background image be centered and covering the whole

11:35.020 --> 11:36.010
div.

11:36.010 --> 11:41.700
So let's go into our menu item and let's do background position.

11:41.740 --> 11:42.000
Right.

11:42.010 --> 11:50.140
We want it to always be center and then we want the background size to be cover.

11:50.140 --> 11:53.560
So we want our background image to cover the whole thing.

11:53.590 --> 11:56.160
And then the position should always be in the center.

11:56.230 --> 12:04.300
And now if we look we see that our component has our images but if we look at this this is a little

12:04.300 --> 12:11.960
bigger as well right than these ones so we know that these two need to be a larger size.

12:12.530 --> 12:14.120
So how do we do this.

12:14.120 --> 12:21.320
Well typically in normal CSX we could just add a class that would tell this component that it's larger

12:21.320 --> 12:23.740
so it should have size related to that.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.720
Well we can do that as well with react.

12:26.720 --> 12:38.120
So inside of our directory what we can do is we can actually pass in a size value which is equal to

12:39.110 --> 12:39.700
large.

12:39.770 --> 12:40.940
Right.

12:41.120 --> 12:48.590
And then we do that for our last two for our men's and our women's sections and then we can just pass

12:48.590 --> 12:52.280
that size value also into our component

12:55.630 --> 13:06.700
and now on our menu item component we can also dynamically add in our class name value right here.

13:06.810 --> 13:07.480
Right.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.990
Because we are getting this size value.

13:10.050 --> 13:15.690
If it's nothing it's not going to render anything but if it is present then we want to add it to our

13:15.690 --> 13:16.250
class name.

13:16.920 --> 13:28.140
So let's just string interpolate in that value with this sorry with size.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.120
All right.

13:29.320 --> 13:40.950
And then we also always wanted to have what we had earlier which was menu item and now if we look at

13:41.070 --> 13:51.740
our core menu item code we also gonna add in that style for it by doing Ampersand sign.

13:51.770 --> 14:04.550
So if our menu item also has dots large then we want to give it a larger height of 3 engine 80 pixels

14:05.600 --> 14:12.800
and now if we save and we go back we see that our images these ones are large but these ones stay the

14:12.800 --> 14:13.250
same.

14:13.250 --> 14:13.710
Right.

14:13.730 --> 14:22.830
They haven't changed so that's one of the great things we can do with building out are components is

14:22.830 --> 14:30.630
that we can use these properties and we can write JavaScript to give them a dynamically changing value

14:30.660 --> 14:38.550
so that it lends us a lot more flexibility when we're building and styling our components OK.

14:38.700 --> 14:44.880
Now in the next section we're going to style this menu item a little bit more with some of those transitions

14:45.270 --> 14:48.060
and some of these colors that we see in our final product.
