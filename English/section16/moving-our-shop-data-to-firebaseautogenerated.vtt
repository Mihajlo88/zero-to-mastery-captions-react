00:00.820 --> 00:07.870
So now that we know the two types of objects references and snapshots that we can get back from the

00:07.870 --> 00:16.770
fire store library let's actually talk about the structure of our database on fire store.

00:16.810 --> 00:22.930
So let's go back to fire store and let's look at our collections.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.370
So we only have one collection right now.

00:25.420 --> 00:34.090
Our users collection if we look at our users collection and we look at how this database looks we can

00:34.240 --> 00:41.890
almost see that this collection of users is like an object.

00:41.910 --> 00:50.280
There is this key of users that points to this object that contains these key ideas that point to the

00:50.370 --> 00:58.190
actual value of an object that contains the document information.

00:58.220 --> 01:01.720
This is almost identical to our shop data.

01:01.730 --> 01:11.510
If you look at our shop data is an object that has these keys of these category names that point to

01:11.510 --> 01:19.140
these objects that hold the values of these actual categories.

01:19.140 --> 01:28.630
This is by no means a coincidence firebase is what's considered a no sequel database the no sequel database

01:28.720 --> 01:35.770
is different from a sequel database because of the way that it can store data.

01:35.800 --> 01:42.880
We'll talk about sequel databases more in a later lesson as well as how they differ from no single databases.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.450
But let's first explore no sequel databases because we're using firestorm right now

01:51.770 --> 01:55.420
just like our chase on objects inside of our front end.

01:55.490 --> 02:03.950
They can have any number of properties and values are user documents right now have the same properties

02:04.670 --> 02:13.010
and the same values as each other in the sense that both documents have created at a display name and

02:13.100 --> 02:23.170
email property but it doesn't have to be the case we can make a new user document that has completely

02:23.170 --> 02:33.110
different fields from the other objects this one can have a name where the value can say you or it can

02:33.140 --> 02:44.000
even have an address value that says let's say Toronto our object is still a user Document object but

02:44.030 --> 02:49.100
it's different from the other user documents inside of the collection.

02:49.100 --> 02:56.090
This becomes troublesome because on our front end if we get all these documents we might not know that

02:56.090 --> 03:06.020
these values are different but the advantage is that you're able to have these really flexible documents

03:06.050 --> 03:15.050
that can store any properties right regardless of what the actual conflict on the front end will be

03:16.350 --> 03:23.640
we'll explore that later as well but that's just one thing to keep in mind is that when we're using

03:23.670 --> 03:34.680
a no secret database we have to make sure that we enforce ourselves to store the same values across

03:34.680 --> 03:42.240
our documents if we can because we don't want to pull in all of our users and iterate through them only

03:42.240 --> 03:50.040
to find that some objects don't have properties that we expect them to have beyond that.

03:50.050 --> 03:55.340
The other thing to keep in mind is what types of properties we can store.

03:55.510 --> 04:02.630
Now let's look at what types of properties we can actually store on documents so here we can see that

04:02.630 --> 04:07.500
we can add a field as we did earlier and this is the field name.

04:07.730 --> 04:16.520
And this is the type that this field expects the value to be so we can have strings numbers boolean

04:16.790 --> 04:24.440
and then we see here maps maps you can pretty much see as Jason objects and we would prefer to store

04:24.440 --> 04:32.930
a list of things as maps because as we saw with our data normalization course that it's easier for the

04:32.930 --> 04:41.830
fire store database to find specific elements inside of a list by the property name or the key rather

04:41.830 --> 04:46.690
than just searching through an array for what the element is which is the same reason why we switched

04:46.690 --> 04:56.530
our shot data from an array to an object arrays are not actually arrays inside a fire store their maps

04:56.590 --> 04:59.960
except the index is the key.

05:00.010 --> 05:02.710
So the first element has a key of zero.

05:02.710 --> 05:04.720
The second has a key of one.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.590
The third a key of two and so on and so forth.

05:08.230 --> 05:13.330
So they're kind of like maps that resemble arrays and we'll explore those later you don't have to get

05:13.330 --> 05:20.200
too caught up in them there's no there's timestamp which is like a date object and then there's geo

05:20.200 --> 05:25.690
point which is kind of like a coordinate but we don't have to worry about these two we're probably also

05:25.690 --> 05:31.550
not use them so those are the types of properties we can store.

05:31.630 --> 05:39.910
Now what we want to do is we actually want to add in our collection from our code base because manually

05:39.970 --> 05:45.310
adding a collection and adding all the documents and the field is going to be extremely tedious for

05:45.310 --> 05:48.210
this huge object that we have here.

05:48.220 --> 05:55.970
So what we'll do is we'll actually make a new you tell for it and we'll make a you tool that we can

05:55.970 --> 05:58.530
see ourselves using again in the future.

05:58.580 --> 06:11.820
So what we'll call our you tool is export concept ad collection and items and what it will take is a

06:11.820 --> 06:17.120
collection name or we can call it collection key

06:21.010 --> 06:29.200
and then we can say for the objects that we want to add in let's call it objects to add which can be

06:29.200 --> 06:33.320
an array now inside of our function.

06:33.610 --> 06:41.380
What we're going to do is we are going to create the collection using the collection key so we will

06:41.380 --> 06:52.710
get back a collection ref from fire store dot collection and then passing in our collection key.

06:52.890 --> 06:58.570
And if you remember firebase will give us back a rough object no matter what.

06:58.680 --> 07:03.930
And this is great for us because using this collection ref we don't actually have to manually make one

07:03.990 --> 07:06.130
in the database firebase.

07:06.150 --> 07:12.330
We'll make this collection rough object for us and then if we start adding elements to it as documents

07:12.690 --> 07:18.510
then firebase will start creating both the collection and the documents inside a fire store.

07:18.540 --> 07:24.210
In fact let's actually rename our function to add collection and documents because that's what we're

07:24.220 --> 07:26.890
adding documents not items.

07:26.910 --> 07:33.060
Now what we need to do is we need to call our ad collection and documents function somewhere in our

07:33.150 --> 07:36.790
app where we have access to the shop data.

07:36.840 --> 07:43.530
Now we can get access by passing the data in through a selector but we do want to only fire this function

07:43.530 --> 07:44.760
one time.

07:44.760 --> 07:51.810
So let's do it in our app because our app only mounts once and after we've updated our data in our fire

07:51.810 --> 07:52.350
store.

07:52.350 --> 07:57.240
We're going to remove this code because we only want to add it programmatically.

07:57.240 --> 07:57.620
Right.

07:57.630 --> 08:03.480
We're just adding our shop data to our back end one time so we don't have to write it out by hand in

08:03.480 --> 08:04.890
our fire store.

08:04.920 --> 08:10.620
So what we'll do is we will actually bring in our selector from redux.

08:10.620 --> 08:21.950
So let's bring it in from our redux folder shop and our shop selectors and then we need are select collections

08:22.520 --> 08:31.240
for preview and also our new function add collection and documents.

08:31.280 --> 08:38.690
So now that we have these imported in let's put this in our map state to props as the collections array

08:42.190 --> 08:50.050
and what we'll do is we will D structure our collections array from our props and pass it into our new

08:50.080 --> 09:02.090
function so what we'll need is the key which is collections and our collections array and now if we

09:02.090 --> 09:07.310
look inside of our console we'll see our collections reference where the I.D. points the collections

09:07.550 --> 09:17.060
but we'll also see in our crown firebase that if we refresh we won't see the collection which is exactly

09:17.060 --> 09:20.150
what we want because we haven't instantiated any documents in it.

09:20.180 --> 09:27.700
So the reference doesn't truly point to anything real in the database yet and now that we have our collection

09:27.700 --> 09:35.710
ref we need to actually add these objects into this collection and we'll do it in the next video because

09:35.710 --> 09:39.840
this video is getting a little bit long so I'll see you guys in the next video.
