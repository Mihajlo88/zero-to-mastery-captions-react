00:01.090 --> 00:02.070
Welcome back.

00:03.010 --> 00:12.700
In this section of the course we are going to take a deeper dive into both firebase as well as advanced

00:12.790 --> 00:14.950
redux concepts.

00:14.950 --> 00:21.940
Now I've structured the next two sections in such a way where we do the firebase first where we add

00:21.940 --> 00:30.370
more firebase functionality and utility into our application before we tackle the advanced redux topics

00:30.700 --> 00:39.070
because we need the appropriate environment to see the kind of problems that these advanced redux solutions

00:39.130 --> 00:40.690
will solve.

00:40.720 --> 00:48.880
In particular what we're going to solve in redux will be handling a synchronous actions and asynchronous

00:48.880 --> 00:53.550
events using redux as you know right now.

00:53.570 --> 00:59.200
Most of our actions pretty much just update the reduced reduces in a very synchronous manner.

00:59.210 --> 01:08.060
There is no a synchronous activity in our redux action creators at all nor do we use it to handle anything

01:08.120 --> 01:16.240
a synchronous we call them in a very synchronous way but this will change especially inside larger scale

01:16.270 --> 01:23.680
applications where the common practice is to use redux to handle a synchronous activity inside of our

01:23.710 --> 01:33.940
application but before we actually do that we need to set up our application to utilize more of a database

01:34.360 --> 01:36.720
to get its items.

01:36.760 --> 01:45.700
Now of course right now we do use Firebase authentication to handle the storage of our user and we get

01:45.700 --> 01:48.490
it from a back end in a very asynchronous manner.

01:48.880 --> 01:57.350
But we can actually use it to also store our collection items that we use to get the shop items.

01:57.370 --> 02:08.060
Now if you remember right now we store it in our front end underneath the shop data J.S. file and this

02:08.060 --> 02:16.340
is fine for us because it has no real impact on our performance and it's really just a practice application

02:16.460 --> 02:24.740
where this is probably never going to update in a real world setting however this will sit on a database

02:24.770 --> 02:32.980
because there's a chance that multiple platforms will utilize this data so you can imagine if we had

02:32.980 --> 02:39.670
a mobile application as well as our web application that would both need to reference the shop items

02:40.240 --> 02:44.690
and those items would hallways have to be up to date on both platforms.

02:44.920 --> 02:51.700
So keeping it on a database makes sure that the information that we get guarding what items to display

02:52.300 --> 02:55.920
is always consistent and from one single source.

02:56.020 --> 03:02.170
Otherwise if we were to keep this data on the front end and on the mobile application for example it

03:02.170 --> 03:08.950
would be hard for us to guarantee that both data sets are the exact same because we would have to update

03:08.950 --> 03:09.940
it on our front end.

03:10.390 --> 03:16.390
Updated on our mobile whereas if we were to keep this all in one place in a database of some kind and

03:16.390 --> 03:24.520
then just fetch from it from our respective applications then we can be sure that such data is pure

03:24.550 --> 03:25.650
and exactly the same.

03:27.430 --> 03:34.310
Now in order for us to do this we will have to 1 put this information actually on our firebase fire

03:34.300 --> 03:41.830
store database but also set up our application in such a way that we would fetch from that database

03:41.920 --> 03:49.790
whenever the respective correct components need that data and that will be way more akin to what a final

03:49.820 --> 03:51.930
application actually looks like.

03:51.950 --> 04:00.670
But in order for us to do so we need to get better at understanding how to use fire bases firestorm.

04:00.720 --> 04:09.570
So what we'll do is we will take a quick refresher on how we've already used fire store and dive deeper

04:09.630 --> 04:18.770
into what we've already done as well as understand what the fire store library does for us so before

04:18.770 --> 04:25.040
we begin let's take a look at what kind of objects we can get back from fire store.
