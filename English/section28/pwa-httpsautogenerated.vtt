00:02.260 --> 00:03.470
Welcome back.

00:03.510 --> 00:10.000
In this video we're going to talk about this first point HDB s and why we need it for progressive web

00:10.000 --> 00:18.770
apps now progressive web apps have a certain checklist you can check out on the progressive Web app

00:18.890 --> 00:19.850
checklist.

00:19.850 --> 00:23.050
And I know I know I said that there isn't a checklist.

00:23.050 --> 00:26.680
Think of it think of progressive web apps as a running list.

00:26.840 --> 00:32.200
But that's because these are probably going to get constantly updated and changed.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.670
Now this checklist as you go through it does look a little bit overwhelming.

00:38.860 --> 00:44.950
But we've been following good practices while building our apps just like we did with robo friends.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.370
And you've actually done most of these things.

00:48.580 --> 00:58.800
So that's why instead of showing you this we only really need to focus on three main things that a progressive

00:58.890 --> 01:07.200
web app needs to do now beside these there's a few features but the adoption for them such as push notifications

01:07.470 --> 01:13.540
haven't been that smooth or are still in the works.

01:13.560 --> 01:19.770
So for now we're going to focus on things that you can implement right now fully and be confident that

01:19.770 --> 01:22.230
they're going to work in your app.

01:22.230 --> 01:32.970
So HDTV S HD G.P.S. as you know since we mentioned it a little bit in the SSA section prevents bad actors

01:33.180 --> 01:41.720
from tampering with communications between our app and browser so that if we're sending let's say a

01:41.720 --> 01:49.910
user name and password to our server we can encrypt it so that that message that includes our password

01:50.150 --> 01:59.450
travels to the server in an encrypted fashion so that if Bob the evil third party hacker is trying to

01:59.630 --> 02:06.230
intercept the messages and read them even if he intercepts the message he won't understand it because

02:06.260 --> 02:07.970
it's encrypted.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.890
And again this is something that we talked about in my previous course.

02:11.960 --> 02:22.330
Now Google is really pushing for this HDP US encryption and if we go back to our Web sites we see that

02:22.570 --> 02:29.610
a G.P.S. we have this little nice lock icon with secure that's a good sign.

02:29.660 --> 02:34.930
Chrome has actually updated so that if you have any sort of forms on your Web site and they're not a

02:34.930 --> 02:38.510
CTP yes they'll show up here as not secure.

02:39.110 --> 02:42.440
Pretty much shaming Web sites for not using a yes.

02:42.650 --> 02:48.990
So anytime you're sending data from the client to the server you should be using 82 B.S..

02:49.250 --> 02:55.430
Now why do we need that though for progressive web apps and that is because progressive web apps use

02:55.430 --> 03:03.380
some features that we're going to talk about in other videos that require a GDP yes for security reasons

03:04.040 --> 03:11.220
although this is a requirement for progressive web app in general you should always serve your Web sites

03:11.540 --> 03:19.150
if there's any sort of communication with the server through HDD and if we go to our lighthouse report

03:19.810 --> 03:25.930
you see that when you scroll to progressive web app and we check out the nine past audits that we had

03:26.350 --> 03:32.710
we have users ACP yes as one of the requirements but how did that happen.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.990
How do we have HDP s already.

03:34.990 --> 03:39.620
And luckily for us we get this out of the box with get hub pages.

03:39.700 --> 03:47.080
You can see over here that this link that was generated is a GDP s so anytime you put a Web site on

03:47.080 --> 03:52.600
get how pages we automatically get this encryption which is fantastic.

03:55.030 --> 03:59.190
Not all Web sites can be hosted on GitHub pages.

03:59.260 --> 04:06.790
You probably want to have your own server your own domain name Well the easiest way to get a G.P.S.

04:07.240 --> 04:14.030
is probably through Let's Encrypt Let's Encrypt is a free.

04:14.240 --> 04:19.970
And it writes It says over here it's a free automated and open Certificate Authority.

04:19.970 --> 04:22.720
And they're fantastic to use.

04:22.720 --> 04:29.300
And a certificate authority is just this authority that says I'll give you a certificate to certify

04:29.330 --> 04:36.710
that yes you are indeed whoever you say you are whatever your domain name is and let's encrypt gives

04:36.710 --> 04:39.230
you free certificates.

04:39.230 --> 04:43.190
That is really really easy to setup and they have great documentation for you to use.

04:43.970 --> 04:45.850
I highly recommend the.

04:46.020 --> 04:53.520
You also have something like CloudFlare and Cluff there is a C.D. and or a content delivery network

04:53.940 --> 04:57.660
which we're going to talk about in later sections.

04:57.660 --> 05:03.870
But for now you can think of them as a server that you can put your files on and just like get hub pages

05:03.870 --> 05:14.370
that hosts your files on their servers CloudFlare hosts your site on their pages and automatically through

05:14.370 --> 05:16.310
them you get a sheet.

05:16.330 --> 05:17.240
Yes.

05:17.440 --> 05:23.880
And if you go to their pricing they're actually very very generous and there's a free plan for personal

05:23.880 --> 05:27.660
blog posts and any simple Web sites that you have.

05:27.660 --> 05:33.180
Again I highly recommend them and they actually do improve your performance of the Web site as well.

05:33.180 --> 05:39.920
Again something that we'll get into in the performance part 3 section going back to our Web site.

05:39.940 --> 05:46.740
This is something that we get out of the box our app is going to work with all the other features of

05:46.740 --> 05:53.580
progressive web app because it's on GitHub pages and we automatically get this issue to be s awesome

05:54.000 --> 06:03.090
and we can double checked over here with pre act how can use that yep indeed they are using a sheet

06:03.090 --> 06:05.670
G.P.S. as well.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.160
All right.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.640
That's it for now.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.530
I'll see in the next one by.
