00:01.430 --> 00:02.830
Think of a progressive web app.

00:02.840 --> 00:05.750
More like a running list of things you can do.

00:05.750 --> 00:07.960
They in a static list.

00:07.970 --> 00:14.000
It's going to evolve over time but the idea is to make user experience as we know as close as possible

00:14.060 --> 00:16.390
to a native app.

00:16.490 --> 00:19.310
By the way maybe you don't trust me.

00:19.310 --> 00:24.710
Maybe you think that this progressive web app is just pure hype and on JS just teaching us something

00:24.710 --> 00:26.710
that won't exist in two years.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.570
Well companies like Twitter

00:33.630 --> 00:40.890
have adopted progressive web apps so much so that Twitter has moved all of their mobile web traffic

00:41.190 --> 00:52.450
to a react progressive web app Ali Baba dot com Yeah they use a progressive web app Lyft and Uber uses

00:52.480 --> 00:59.170
a progressive web app Lyft for example has a goal of making their progressive web app a 100 percent

00:59.410 --> 01:08.170
parody or have complete feature set that their mobile phone has their mobile app has to be the exact

01:08.170 --> 01:17.130
same as their web app and there's tons of companies that are adopting progressive web apps because it

01:17.130 --> 01:18.840
is so beneficial.

01:18.870 --> 01:27.600
Let me show you a few examples to really emphasize and make you understand what this P.W. yay is one

01:27.600 --> 01:31.760
of the great examples that I like is this pocket X dot org Web site.

01:31.860 --> 01:37.680
A very very simple Web site that shows you PokÃ©mon information.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.990
Everybody loves that.

01:40.180 --> 01:53.290
Now this is a progressive web app Well how so if I go open up the developer tools and you see over here

01:53.320 --> 02:00.950
if I click on the icon that shows toggle device toolbar and I scroll down here

02:03.950 --> 02:12.320
will show me the mobile view of this app let me scroll down so we can see it fully and we see over here

02:12.320 --> 02:15.260
that it looks pretty good on mobile.

02:15.260 --> 02:25.440
I can even turn it around and we also have the menu that's working but the cool part about this is if

02:25.440 --> 02:34.850
I turn off my Wi-Fi which usually gives us that blank page with the dinosaur on Chrome saying we don't

02:34.850 --> 02:38.500
have an internet connection well check this out.

02:38.530 --> 02:49.830
This still works how cool is that if I had this on my phone even though I don't have an internet connection

02:50.280 --> 02:55.690
I'd be able to still check out all these poker machines.

02:55.710 --> 03:02.680
All right let's turn back the Wi-Fi and take a look at another Web site.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.640
And this is the Hacker News progressive web apps.

03:07.180 --> 03:13.120
And you can think of it as a playground where people try and rebuild the Hacker News Web site using

03:13.150 --> 03:18.420
a progressive web app and you can see here it gives us the lighthouse score.

03:18.580 --> 03:26.680
It gives us some important metrics like how fast are what page loads and you can even look at the code

03:26.830 --> 03:30.660
of people that have implemented this.

03:30.730 --> 03:37.450
Now let's click on The View app over here for one of the examples we see over here that we just have

03:37.450 --> 03:45.570
a simple Hacker News Web site the cool part about this and this is a thing that we'll talk about later

03:45.570 --> 03:51.300
on in the videos is if I open this tab and let's scroll this tab up.

03:51.300 --> 03:51.630
Now

03:54.650 --> 04:05.350
and we go to application scroll all the way up to what we call the manifest we see over here that there

04:05.350 --> 04:12.670
is a add to home screen button and this add to home screen button appears for mobile users.

04:12.820 --> 04:19.150
If I visited this site multiple times it's going to have a pop up and you might have seen it seen this

04:19.150 --> 04:24.070
while browsing the web as well that says Hey do you want to add this to your home screen.

04:24.370 --> 04:33.570
You see over here if I click that I get this little notification if I click on Add I can add the application

04:33.630 --> 04:35.280
will keep the name the same

04:38.380 --> 04:50.540
and now on my desktop and now on my desktop look at that I have pre act Hacker News app straight on

04:50.540 --> 04:52.520
this desktop.

04:52.520 --> 04:56.270
And it opens up right away.

04:56.270 --> 05:04.200
If I turned off the Wi-Fi and opened this up again we see that it still works.

05:05.820 --> 05:12.390
How cool is that and you still see the you are Albar because this is a browser but if we were on a mobile

05:12.390 --> 05:16.250
phone you actually wouldn't see this.

05:16.420 --> 05:21.150
Your Albar and it will feel completely like an app.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.040
Very very cool.

05:24.240 --> 05:30.000
You see here that we don't completely have full features because you still need Wi-Fi for some parts

05:30.210 --> 05:31.110
but that's OK.

05:31.140 --> 05:31.410
Right.

05:31.400 --> 05:37.360
Good because native apps work like that to.

05:37.470 --> 05:38.090
There you go.

05:38.190 --> 05:41.640
Starting to load now.

05:41.690 --> 05:41.990
All right.

05:42.290 --> 05:48.800
So I think that's enough examples to prove to you that maybe we should consider doing this whole progressive

05:48.800 --> 05:53.680
web app thing in the next few videos.

05:53.840 --> 05:59.200
I'm going to show you the three most important parts to build our own progressive web app.

05:59.510 --> 06:06.500
And we're going to talk about these three topics so that our robo friends app is going to be a progressive

06:06.500 --> 06:08.760
web app by the end of this section.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.940
And Bruno is going to love us for it.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.720
I'll see you in the next one.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.070
Bye bye.
