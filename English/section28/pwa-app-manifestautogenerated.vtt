00:01.770 --> 00:02.960
Welcome back.

00:02.970 --> 00:10.770
Let's talk about the second point of making a progressive web app and probably the cutest little icon

00:10.890 --> 00:13.590
that I'm going to have in this course.

00:13.590 --> 00:21.020
The app manifest now for a progressive web app to behave like a native app.

00:21.110 --> 00:30.200
We need to mimic not just the function of a native app but also some of the views that we get with it

00:30.260 --> 00:31.700
or the shell.

00:31.940 --> 00:38.900
For example on your phone you can download an app and have an app icon on Android devices you have things

00:38.900 --> 00:40.930
such as splash screens.

00:40.940 --> 00:50.990
The idea is to make the web app as indistinguishable as possible to a real mobile app and we can do

00:50.990 --> 00:54.960
that with the app manifest before we get into it though.

00:55.020 --> 01:03.890
The one thing I do want to point is that a lot of people forget to include in their index that a shemale

01:03.890 --> 01:09.600
file this line over here and this comes out of the box with create react app.

01:09.610 --> 01:15.500
You can see that I'm in the public index not Asian mail folder and this line which is the meta tag with

01:15.500 --> 01:20.480
viewport optimizes the app for multiple devices.

01:20.690 --> 01:25.580
And this might seem super obvious but a lot of people forget it.

01:25.580 --> 01:32.850
And this line helps with adjusting the screen size based on the device.

01:32.860 --> 01:40.330
So this is a must and it will warn you if you're missing this line and the lighthouse report.

01:40.330 --> 01:47.950
So now that we have the screen setup for mobile devices let's talk about the app manifest file and as

01:47.950 --> 01:54.790
you can see in our public folder again this is something that we get for free from create react app

01:56.150 --> 01:57.580
and this is it.

01:57.710 --> 02:01.410
This is the manifest Dodd Jason File.

02:01.470 --> 02:07.530
It's a simple Jason File that gives the developers the ability to control how the app should appear

02:07.950 --> 02:16.960
to the user in areas where they would expect to see apps such as the mobile device home screen and just

02:17.080 --> 02:21.610
define how the app is going to launch and how it's going to look.

02:21.610 --> 02:29.500
So if you remember in my example over here with this hacker new SAP we had the ad to home screen button

02:29.800 --> 02:36.380
in the application tab and you might have noticed that we actually clicked on this thing called manifest

02:36.620 --> 02:46.710
in the application and that's the manifest dot Jason File the browser reads this and spits out this

02:46.710 --> 02:49.420
little piece of information for us.

02:49.500 --> 02:58.690
And if I scroll down you see that I have icons here that get downloaded just like I did for when I downloaded

02:58.690 --> 03:01.100
it onto my home screen.

03:01.450 --> 03:06.860
And this is the icon that you'll see when you download this app on your mobile phone.

03:07.060 --> 03:13.810
And it also gives us this nice little feature to add to home screen.

03:13.870 --> 03:17.500
So this is the app manifest file and what it does.

03:17.530 --> 03:26.560
Now how do we generate these icons we see over here that create react app has generated a father called

03:27.700 --> 03:33.060
in the public folder but we're missing a few things aren't we.

03:33.070 --> 03:40.150
We don't have all these other sized icons for mobile phones because we still need to generate them for

03:40.150 --> 03:41.240
our app.

03:41.260 --> 03:50.440
You can see here that they have different sizes based on whichever device this gets downloaded on luckily

03:50.440 --> 03:50.840
for us.

03:50.850 --> 03:55.270
There's a great tool that does this very nicely and easily.

03:55.340 --> 04:06.140
It's called real time econ generator and this all we need to do is provide an image such as an image

04:06.170 --> 04:15.590
of a robot by just clicking on select to have a compactor and we'll take you through the steps to download

04:15.590 --> 04:23.090
these and all we need to do is include them in our public folder just like the fab on icon laws and

04:23.090 --> 04:25.440
reference them in the manifest.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.120
Dot JSA.

04:27.380 --> 04:34.100
And don't worry this is exactly what we're going to do in our exercise to turn our robo friends up into

04:34.430 --> 04:36.460
a progressive web app.

04:36.470 --> 04:46.130
Another thing that this Web site does for us is previewing and customizing the splash screen for our

04:46.130 --> 04:48.030
manifest file.

04:48.070 --> 04:53.950
Now what is a splash screen in older versions of Chrome for Android.

04:54.400 --> 05:02.590
Tapping on the home screen icon for an app would often take up to a couple of hundred milliseconds before

05:02.650 --> 05:04.670
that screen gets loaded.

05:04.750 --> 05:13.130
A user would see a white screen which makes the experience a little bit jarring and it looks like the

05:13.130 --> 05:15.590
Web site is loading really slow.

05:15.980 --> 05:23.930
So chrome 47 and above support this idea of a splash screen where you can add a background color when

05:23.930 --> 05:26.480
you tap on the app.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.240
The progressive web app instead of loading the white screen it's going to load something called a splash

05:32.240 --> 05:39.930
screen where it'll have the background color the name an icon of the web app and you will get that all

05:39.930 --> 05:43.320
from our manifest the Jason File.

05:43.320 --> 05:50.290
And this is all done simply to make your web app feel a lot closer to what you see with native apps.

05:50.430 --> 05:55.830
When you click on native apps even if they're loading they have some sort of a background an icon to

05:55.830 --> 05:58.130
show you that it is loading.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.070
Overall though that's it.

06:00.070 --> 06:01.510
That's pretty simple right.

06:01.510 --> 06:05.850
All we need is some icons and add them to manifest Dot.

06:05.910 --> 06:09.450
Jason JSA that's it for now.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.100
I'll see in the next one.

06:11.120 --> 06:11.540
Bye bye.
