Now that we understand progressive web apps I just wanted to add a few closing thoughts progressive

00:07.710 --> 00:10.500
web apps have a great goal in mind.

00:10.860 --> 00:20.100
Make Web sites faster and better for the user however as with all new technology it still has some kinks

00:20.190 --> 00:20.790
to work out.

00:22.260 --> 00:26.700
As you can imagine it isn't really in the best interests of Apple.

00:26.850 --> 00:33.020
As we mentioned before that's why safari support is really slow right now for progressive web apps will

00:33.090 --> 00:34.490
improve over time.

00:34.710 --> 00:39.190
But you have to be careful between the browsers what works and what doesn't.

00:39.210 --> 00:46.020
When building a progressive web apps things such as push notifications can be achieved on some browsers

00:46.110 --> 00:55.350
and not others and push API and the notification API that uses push notifications requires integration

00:55.350 --> 00:56.440
with the end.

00:56.550 --> 00:59.380
That adds an extra layer of complexity.

00:59.670 --> 01:04.680
And does everybody love push notifications and getting bugged from an app.

01:05.870 --> 01:10.940
I know that when I'm visiting a Web site getting notifications to add it to my home screen is really

01:10.940 --> 01:12.350
really annoying.

01:12.350 --> 01:19.270
Did you actually ever download an app to home screen notification companies like Twitter and Tinder

01:19.270 --> 01:26.410
use progressive web apps and companies like Lyft are really trying to make their progressive web apps

01:26.560 --> 01:33.580
as similar as possible to their native apps which is always a good sign with these sort of technologies.

01:33.580 --> 01:37.050
Be careful not to just get caught up in the hype.

01:37.150 --> 01:43.810
Every situation is different and depending on your project goals you may or may not benefit from progressive

01:43.810 --> 01:49.780
web apps as always decide if the effort is worth the benefit.

01:49.780 --> 01:56.320
Luckily for most projects progressive web apps does help because even if it's not all the features that

01:56.320 --> 02:02.550
are being used the browsers that do support it will give a better experience for the user.
