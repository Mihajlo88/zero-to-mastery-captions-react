00:00.790 --> 00:01.480
Welcome back.

00:02.440 --> 00:05.330
So I actually made a small error in our naming.

00:05.350 --> 00:10.270
This is actually not category we are supposed to call it collection.

00:10.270 --> 00:16.210
So let's actually make the correct modifications to our code so it's more aligned with what it should

00:16.210 --> 00:16.450
be.

00:17.620 --> 00:23.840
So this should be a collection and then we'll rename our category to collection

00:28.830 --> 00:37.810
and we should also change it in our import as well as on our actual route in our shop component.

00:39.510 --> 00:41.010
So let's call this collection.

00:44.890 --> 00:51.120
And what we'll export out should be a collection page.

00:51.140 --> 00:57.930
This should now be collection I.D. and this should say collection page.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.100
And this should say collection

01:06.300 --> 01:13.060
so a small mistake but easily remedied by changing all the names in the right places.

01:13.130 --> 01:19.960
And now we just gotta make sure to save and be importing the correct thing.

01:19.970 --> 01:22.750
So we've got to change it in our shop component too.

01:22.760 --> 01:29.880
So we need our collection page from our collection collection component

01:36.600 --> 01:39.510
just a small little error in our naming convention.

01:39.510 --> 01:45.330
But now if we go back we see that everything's still working okay.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.660
Let's go back to building our selector.
