00:01.250 --> 00:07.670
In this video we're going to talk about how to contribute to open source and actually take you through

00:07.670 --> 00:17.410
the steps but first for those who don't know what is open source well a lot of technology that has been

00:17.410 --> 00:25.000
created on the Internet that we know today has been built on top of open source projects and open source

00:25.000 --> 00:29.140
projects means that anybody can view the code.

00:29.140 --> 00:36.860
Anybody can see the code of a program can inspected can modify it can enhance it in this way.

00:36.880 --> 00:43.180
The idea is that by sharing this information with everybody we get everybody's input and we use the

00:43.180 --> 00:46.570
collective mind to improve software.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.230
Not only that but it also benefits everybody.

00:50.230 --> 00:51.200
Right.

00:51.400 --> 00:59.320
For example the most famous example of an open source project is Linux an operating system just like

00:59.320 --> 01:11.170
Windows or Mac OS except it's built by everyday programmers and it's code that is completely open sourced.

01:11.170 --> 01:19.680
Anybody can inspect the code add onto it and it's become so successful that most of the cloud that we

01:19.680 --> 01:28.280
know of the servers usually run Linux a W S Google Cloud Microsoft Azure.

01:28.590 --> 01:31.250
All of them use Linux.

01:31.300 --> 01:38.710
Some of you might be running Linux right now as you watch this video so not only do you get to work

01:38.710 --> 01:44.440
with other developers from around the world where you can build great projects but just working in teams

01:45.040 --> 01:51.970
by learning how open source works well you don't have to create something as big as Linux.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.240
You can create a project with a friend.

01:54.310 --> 01:58.110
Something very small and simple it doesn't really matter.

01:58.120 --> 02:07.640
The idea is of collaboration of openness and sharing code to hopefully improve on the collective knowledge.

02:07.730 --> 02:15.150
Finally a lot of employers actually look upon open source contribution as a plus so if you're able to

02:15.150 --> 02:20.520
put in your resumÃ© that you're an open source contributor Well that's a good sign.

02:20.580 --> 02:26.310
Plus it teaches you valuable skills at using get and get hub to work in teams.

02:26.310 --> 02:31.890
If you're looking for job experience but you don't have a job contributing to open source is the perfect

02:31.890 --> 02:37.650
way for you to learn how to work in teams and mimic a work like scenario.

02:37.650 --> 02:41.370
This is a really important video and something I'm really excited about.

02:41.610 --> 02:47.330
So let's show you how to make your first open source contribution improve your resume.

02:47.430 --> 02:51.340
Learn some real life skills and have fun along the way.

02:53.060 --> 02:59.520
Now we've actually created some open source projects for you for this course.

02:59.530 --> 03:06.400
We have the 0 2 mastery repository here where we can see that we have about 64 projects open right now

03:06.730 --> 03:09.450
with about 2000 contributors.

03:09.460 --> 03:12.880
That's a lot of people in this numbers bound to increase.

03:12.880 --> 03:18.730
Now this place was created as a practice ground for you a playground.

03:18.940 --> 03:25.600
Nobody will yell at you if you break things you can contribute at silly things whatever you want.

03:25.600 --> 03:27.120
It's a testing ground.

03:27.130 --> 03:32.410
The idea is to have as much fun as possible and make it as easy as possible to contribute to open source

03:34.690 --> 03:36.520
now within that organization.

03:36.520 --> 03:42.610
We have a great community of administrator or management team that will help you with these open source

03:42.880 --> 03:45.070
projects by the way.

03:45.070 --> 03:47.100
Who are these administrators.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.340
They're right here.

03:48.440 --> 03:49.160
Ignore my name.

03:49.430 --> 03:56.930
I help out as well but they do a lot of the heavy lifting and they are past students just like you that

03:57.110 --> 03:58.610
have had a bit of experience.

03:58.610 --> 04:06.860
Now most of them are working full time but they are now helping out the community by helping with our

04:06.860 --> 04:11.840
open source projects are discord and generally just helping our community grow.

04:12.380 --> 04:15.020
So shout out to them if you get a chance.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.840
Say hi to them on this court.

04:16.850 --> 04:21.210
They definitely do a lot for this community.

04:21.230 --> 04:26.330
They're very active on discord and they really help maintain all of our open source projects.

04:27.530 --> 04:32.780
So let's learn how to make our very first open source contribution.

04:32.780 --> 04:37.560
I do want to note here that this isn't the only way for you to contribute to open source.

04:37.580 --> 04:40.570
This is just a playground that we've created for you.

04:40.640 --> 04:46.520
But once you contribute here you can go off and contribute to all the other open source projects all

04:46.520 --> 04:47.180
over GitHub.

04:47.180 --> 04:51.820
They can find you can contribute to projects like react and angular.

04:51.890 --> 04:58.580
The world is your oyster or you can just stick to these as we actually have a ton of projects here that

04:58.580 --> 04:59.390
are fun.

04:59.420 --> 05:02.330
We have events going on like October fest.

05:02.330 --> 05:04.720
Well we'll get to that shortly.

05:04.730 --> 05:08.750
We definitely have a great community of developers and we can create some awesome projects together.

05:10.130 --> 05:14.960
Now the way you want to get started is to first go to the start here guidelines

05:17.600 --> 05:25.430
now in the start here guidelines and I'll link to this page you actually have a four step guide to get

05:25.430 --> 05:26.480
started.

05:26.480 --> 05:33.230
The first thing you want to do is to actually watch the guide started guideline a fellow student actually

05:33.230 --> 05:38.600
created this guide for you to follow the steps that I'll mention in this video.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.000
So you always have this as a reference.

05:41.060 --> 05:47.690
So after this video definitely check out this document as a reference but otherwise once you've browsed

05:47.810 --> 05:52.210
through the document is will make your first pull request.

05:52.280 --> 05:57.500
So if you've already watched might get and get hub videos you should be all set.

05:57.530 --> 06:00.210
Otherwise hopefully you're familiar with get and get out.

06:00.620 --> 06:08.530
Now the first thing we want to do is to actually add our names to the contributors dot and define in

06:08.530 --> 06:09.560
this project.

06:09.610 --> 06:15.850
So if you go up you'll see that we have 8 contributors dot M.D. which stands for markdown file and if

06:15.850 --> 06:22.150
I click on here you see that all the contributors that we have we have over a thousand contributors

06:22.450 --> 06:26.140
and if you scroll down these are all their github names.

06:26.290 --> 06:30.690
So your first task is to actually add your name to this list.

06:30.760 --> 06:32.950
So how can we do this.

06:33.070 --> 06:41.530
Well we can just clone this repository but a more recommended way of usually contributing to open source

06:41.830 --> 06:50.140
is to fork the project fork essentially means copy over the entire project and put it on your own get

06:50.140 --> 06:51.690
hub profile.

06:51.730 --> 06:57.640
So if I click fork here and we see over here that you can select where you want to forth the project

06:57.700 --> 07:04.580
and you want to select your profile so once we fork this project we make a copy of it.

07:04.600 --> 07:10.960
It's like we own this repository now with our own version of the start here guidelines.

07:10.960 --> 07:18.420
So once we have this we can clone this repository using SSA H or H2 G.P.S. whatever you prefer.

07:18.460 --> 07:27.090
In my case I'll use SSA so that I don't have to use my password every time I can now say get clone and

07:27.090 --> 07:29.610
clone this repository.

07:29.640 --> 07:39.570
Now we can see these into start here guidelines and we can't open this up in our favorite text editor.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.620
Now once here let's clear this.

07:43.730 --> 07:49.460
We have the contributors file which we need to add our name to.

07:49.470 --> 07:54.800
Now I can see here the contributors file is getting quite long because while we've had a lot of students

07:54.800 --> 07:58.650
who are contributing to open source but at the very end.

07:58.650 --> 08:00.490
Make sure you're at the very end here.

08:00.570 --> 08:02.850
You want to add your own name.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.500
Now here's the thing.

08:05.500 --> 08:11.500
Right now we're on the master branch but I'm going to show you what a good practice is.

08:11.560 --> 08:19.300
We have our forked project and we want to create a new branch to work off of instead of master by saying

08:19.300 --> 08:28.930
get check out dash B to create a new branch and we want to name this branch in our case let's just name

08:28.930 --> 08:29.910
it test.

08:30.390 --> 08:39.220
If I hit enter you'll see that now I'm on a new branch called test and in this branch I can add my name

08:39.220 --> 08:41.100
to this contributor list.

08:41.350 --> 08:44.880
In your case you'll want to use your own GitHub profile.

08:45.100 --> 08:52.330
So we're using markdown here which is a way a syntax to write and has some functionality.

08:52.330 --> 09:00.880
For example if we go to the contributors list you'll notice that they are all clickable links.

09:00.880 --> 09:09.220
So we essentially use the same notation we do a dash square brackets with your get hub user name and

09:09.220 --> 09:15.080
then in the parentheses we just have the actual U.R.L. that you want to link to.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.430
In our case the get hub user name that you have.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.220
So you'll get hub user name here.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.120
Get hub user name here.

09:22.330 --> 09:25.970
Once we do that we can save this file.

09:25.990 --> 09:34.950
Now go back to our terminal and say get status and we see here that yeah we just modified our contributors

09:34.960 --> 09:44.040
dot DFA and if I do get def to see any changes that we've made we see that we've added this new line

09:45.240 --> 09:47.960
so let's clear this.

09:48.130 --> 09:55.330
We have our name all set up and we can now add this commit by saying get ad and dot for everything we'll

09:55.330 --> 10:04.870
add everything and then get commit and we'll write a message that says added my name to contributor

10:05.470 --> 10:08.400
list.

10:08.430 --> 10:10.270
There we go.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.460
So now it's time for us to push these changes.

10:14.540 --> 10:25.060
Now if I do get push origin master well right now what that would mean is that we want to push to origin

10:25.360 --> 10:29.900
and the origin is this start here.

10:29.900 --> 10:36.690
Guideline which I fought so the origin is actually my version of the project and if I want to push to

10:36.690 --> 10:39.380
master that is the main branch.

10:39.600 --> 10:50.880
But we don't want to do that because ideally we want to be able to also change and add our name to the

10:50.880 --> 10:57.760
original 0 2 mastery start here guideline because this is the main.

10:57.910 --> 11:08.360
So what we can do is instead of master push to our test branch so we say get push origin test.

11:08.590 --> 11:09.070
There we go.

11:10.000 --> 11:20.850
Now if I go back here and go to my project and I refreshed I now have two branches the master branch

11:20.880 --> 11:26.080
and also the test branch which I just updated.

11:26.100 --> 11:30.780
So one way to do this is to click on new poll request

11:35.130 --> 11:46.740
and you can add comments here like I've added my name to the list and you can tag some of our maintainers.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.280
In my case I'll just tag myself if I do create pull request

11:54.220 --> 12:03.700
I now have my poor request and notice here how my poor request is now at the 0 2 mastery star here guideline

12:04.630 --> 12:14.390
so that if I go back to our star here guideline I see that I'm part of the pull request now right here

12:15.600 --> 12:21.150
and because I've tagged one of the management teams so in this case it was myself.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.000
Or we can tag any of the management team that we have now.

12:25.100 --> 12:32.840
In this case I'm cheating because I also help manage this so I can just myself merge the poor request

12:32.900 --> 12:36.200
most likely in your case you won't be able to merge it yourself.

12:36.650 --> 12:42.350
But if I click merge and confirm.

12:42.590 --> 12:43.220
There we go.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.340
I've merged my project.

12:45.530 --> 12:50.420
I've deleted the branch and the pull request is closed.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.870
If I want I can even delete my own fork.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.340
But for now let's keep it the way it is.

12:56.390 --> 13:02.200
Let's check the start here guidelines and see if my name has been added to the list.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.940
I scroll all the way down.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.450
Hey check that out.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.830
There's my name on the list.

13:08.870 --> 13:11.860
So I've been added to the contributors list.

13:11.870 --> 13:13.240
It was pretty easy right.

13:13.490 --> 13:23.040
And the cool part is that now if I go to my profile I actually have zero to mastery as one of my organizations.

13:23.050 --> 13:30.670
So if you're able to add yourself to the contributors list you can actually join the 0 2 mastery organization

13:30.850 --> 13:34.600
and have this little icon appear on your get hub profile.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.780
And lots of get tough profiles have organization.

13:37.780 --> 13:41.810
So people usually have their workplace icon in here.

13:41.890 --> 13:46.870
So just a nice little thing to have on your profile to show that you're involved in the programming

13:46.870 --> 13:47.410
community

13:50.370 --> 13:54.810
so we've just made a poor request which is step two.

13:54.810 --> 13:57.380
And that was pretty fast right.

13:57.420 --> 14:04.110
Finally the next step is to go join an actual project and start contributing the way we just learned

14:04.770 --> 14:07.990
in our 0 2 mastery organization.

14:08.010 --> 14:14.580
Now there's actually a guy that we provide for you to figure out what project you choose what's going

14:14.580 --> 14:16.190
to be good for you.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.160
We also have an hour discord.

14:18.210 --> 14:26.130
A group projects section where we can look at some of the current projects that are happening or you

14:26.130 --> 14:34.400
can just go to the 0 2 mastery organization and pick any of the repositories to contribute to.

14:34.470 --> 14:40.800
Now in the next video we're going to contribute to one of these projects and show you a real life scenario

14:42.000 --> 14:43.430
I'll see in that one.
