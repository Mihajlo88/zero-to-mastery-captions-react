00:06.110 --> 00:10.940
And you can already start to see some things that we can clean up here.

00:11.030 --> 00:18.590
We can just copy and paste this let's just create one more instance and says filters robot correctly

00:19.280 --> 00:33.530
to we'll say that the we'll say 3 4 now just to keep this clean we'll say that the concept filter or

00:33.530 --> 00:40.840
filtered robots should equal an empty array.

00:40.840 --> 00:46.230
And this time we're searching for the letter A which doesn't exist in name.

00:46.420 --> 00:56.750
And we expect the filtered robots to equal the dummy filter robots that we gave it

01:00.150 --> 01:00.690
let's save

01:03.750 --> 01:05.430
and we see that something is failing

01:08.350 --> 01:11.290
because my mock props to is not defined.

01:11.290 --> 01:14.620
We need to give it three.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.840
And there you have it.

01:17.010 --> 01:24.420
We've now tested our main page at least the main page method of filtered robots

01:27.250 --> 01:32.380
and we also have some snapshot testing as well so let's just look at our code coverage for now.

01:33.190 --> 01:39.660
Let's just around NPM run test dash dash dash dash coverage

01:44.280 --> 01:48.820
and again this is always with testing there's always many more things they can do.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.670
We see that May.

01:49.710 --> 01:56.860
Main Page has a hundred percent but there is a branch percentage.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.820
We're only testing 50 percent of the branch.

02:00.090 --> 02:03.540
And you see that the uncovered line is on 28.

02:03.540 --> 02:14.230
If we go back we can go to main page and see that we have an is pending on line 28.

02:14.230 --> 02:15.930
How cool is that the test says.

02:16.060 --> 02:18.370
All right we're testing that.

02:18.460 --> 02:27.790
The card list is rendering because we're always testing with is pending is true as you can see here

02:27.820 --> 02:31.910
and our in our mock props.

02:31.990 --> 02:33.850
We always have is pending to false.

02:33.850 --> 02:37.510
So we might want a test is pending to true as well.

02:37.510 --> 02:43.780
And I'm going to leave that up to you to add the important concept here is that there are so many ways

02:43.780 --> 02:45.150
to test.

02:45.280 --> 02:51.040
You can always use the coverage your report as a reference but try to be smart about your tests and

02:51.040 --> 02:57.760
make sure that you spend your time wisely because you're just going to have infinite things that you

02:57.760 --> 03:01.880
can do but you only have limited time.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.220
That's it for now.

03:03.250 --> 03:09.850
I hope you have a better understanding of how container and components testing can be enhanced with

03:10.180 --> 03:12.760
enzyme and snapshot testing.

03:12.760 --> 03:18.700
And obviously the tools that come with just the rest of the test is something I'm leaving up to you

03:18.700 --> 03:21.010
to complete four components and containers.

03:21.010 --> 03:26.010
But let's get to actions constants and reduce hours.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.900
We're gonna want to test those as well.

03:29.110 --> 03:32.020
So in the next video we're going to do just that.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.740
I'll see on that one by.
