Let's talk about the final type of test automation tests now.

00:07.030 --> 00:12.550
You may also hear the term end to end testing when it comes to automation tests.

00:12.550 --> 00:13.810
So keep that in mind.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.150
Automation tests.

00:15.280 --> 00:22.720
Like I said before our UI tests that are always running inside a browser or a browser like environment

00:23.670 --> 00:31.440
because they need to simulate user behavior in these environments such as clicking typing scrolling.

00:31.440 --> 00:38.430
And finally they need to make sure that these scenarios actually work from the point of view of an end

00:38.430 --> 00:39.570
user.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.190
It's an important test right.

00:41.220 --> 00:48.840
If your checkout process has a bug the best way to probably tested is to actually go through that checkout

00:48.840 --> 00:53.710
flow and make sure that users can purchase whatever you're selling.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.060
Now in an ideal world we have automation tests everywhere.

00:58.230 --> 01:05.430
And if any of them fail we know that our web app doesn't work but it's important to remember that these

01:05.430 --> 01:08.910
tests are the hardest to set up.

01:08.910 --> 01:16.770
Imagine yourself creating an environment to run a test on different machines because users have different

01:16.920 --> 01:21.920
computers different devices different phones different browser types.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.700
Different versions.

01:23.910 --> 01:25.980
How can you really test for that.

01:25.980 --> 01:30.670
I mean you can but it's really really hard.

01:30.840 --> 01:37.610
And this is why there's so many services that provide automation testing for you here's an example of

01:37.610 --> 01:40.610
a few of them yep.

01:40.660 --> 01:47.820
These are just a few of them such as Nightwatch web driver I O test cafe nightmare Cyprus.

01:47.860 --> 01:54.760
The list really goes on automation testing is something you usually only find at bigger companies that

01:54.760 --> 02:00.910
have the budget to really spend money on this because there's so many edge cases and they're so expensive

02:00.910 --> 02:07.360
to implement that some developers go their whole career without ever writing an automation test.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.170
But I still want to cover it because it is an important topic.

02:10.670 --> 02:17.620
Here's a quick lowdown though if you just want to get started and not worry about cross browser and

02:17.620 --> 02:25.120
have all the tools in one probably test Cafe is your best choice or if you want the one that has the

02:25.120 --> 02:26.580
best documentation online.

02:26.580 --> 02:29.670
Well web driver IO is really great.

02:29.950 --> 02:38.320
And if you want really simple ways to automate user actions or do something cool like web scraping well

02:38.380 --> 02:40.570
nightmare digest is pretty good.

02:40.840 --> 02:47.420
Now the important thing with automation testing is that like the other name suggests and to a..

02:47.470 --> 02:56.390
Testing you want to test the entire process of your UI and you might be thinking why do we get the machine

02:56.390 --> 02:56.800
to do it.

02:56.810 --> 03:01.520
Why can we just hire people to test for us and do automation testing.

03:01.670 --> 03:09.380
And that happens many companies instead of writing these scripts simply hire people to do automation

03:09.380 --> 03:16.280
testing and at some companies you have people like testers that do this for you and make sure that the

03:16.280 --> 03:21.870
app works as intended and there's pros and cons to both of these.

03:21.970 --> 03:27.390
And that's something that really depend on your company and your work environment.

03:27.400 --> 03:34.360
The main thing I want to suggest though is that we want to create two different testing processes one

03:34.750 --> 03:42.480
for a running unit tests and integration tests and a completely separate one to run these UI tests the

03:42.640 --> 03:44.210
automation test.

03:44.440 --> 03:51.700
That's because UI tests take a longer time especially if we worry about different browsers and different

03:51.700 --> 03:57.260
devices and they also cost a lot more money to run them repeatedly.

03:57.310 --> 04:04.870
So you would want to run unit tests and integration tests often probably in your terminal as your saving

04:05.170 --> 04:12.370
your changes to your code in your local environment and maybe run UI tests once a day or a couple of

04:12.370 --> 04:20.740
times a week or maybe just before you merge into the master branch before you release it to production.

04:20.740 --> 04:24.240
For now though that's it for automation testing.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.210
I'll see in the next one by.
