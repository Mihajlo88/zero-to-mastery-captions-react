00:01.140 --> 00:02.560
Welcome back.

00:02.580 --> 00:04.560
I wanted to take a second here before you.

00:04.560 --> 00:11.790
We keep going with testing our robo friends app to just go over what we've learned from our slides and

00:11.790 --> 00:18.490
how it all makes sense now we learned that now we have just that we can install that provides for us

00:18.700 --> 00:26.590
a test framework something that we can run tests in and this just also comes with an assertion library

00:27.010 --> 00:36.340
where we can use expect dot to be equal or to have or all these things that we can do that we saw in

00:36.340 --> 00:43.990
our cheat sheet to assert something to make sure that this equals this and then we also saw that just

00:43.990 --> 00:50.910
comes with a test runner something that we're able to run the test in and you saw that in my terminal.

00:50.980 --> 00:58.120
I always have those tests running and checking and making sure that things are always passing.

00:58.120 --> 01:07.350
We also saw that we have marking functions that we can use we saw that in our example where we built

01:07.980 --> 01:14.760
our Star Wars API where we got all those people that we could mock the fetch function and make sure

01:14.760 --> 01:21.250
that it was called again something that comes with just sign on is another popular one that it works

01:21.250 --> 01:23.680
very very similar that you're going to see as well.

01:24.130 --> 01:31.930
And then finally we saw that we can do code coverage by running NPM test dash dash dash dash coverage

01:32.470 --> 01:36.910
and it gives us a coverage of where we have tests and where we don't.

01:36.910 --> 01:38.840
So that we can improve our app.

01:38.980 --> 01:42.970
I told you this is going to make sense and we're not even done yet.

01:43.000 --> 01:53.230
We saw that we can test our app programmatically but if we need any time to use some DOM API we have

01:53.230 --> 01:59.890
those three options we can use the actual Don we can use something like puppeteer for a headless browser

02:00.190 --> 02:08.350
or something like J.S. Dom which if we're using the Mount rendering an enzyme we can set up as well.

02:08.530 --> 02:09.320
Again.

02:09.400 --> 02:17.320
This setup is fairly simple and you can check it out on the enzyme documentation Oh yeah and we also

02:17.320 --> 02:23.270
learned that in react we can use enzyme and snapshot testing to make our tests super super easy.

02:23.290 --> 02:30.360
Again another reason that I love using just especially with react projects that was a quick break back

02:30.360 --> 02:33.860
to coding we go in the next video see you on that one by.
