00:02.090 --> 00:04.280
Welcome back now.

00:04.400 --> 00:10.160
Tests in general can be grouped into three main categories.

00:10.160 --> 00:16.880
Now everybody has their own definition and sometimes somebodies definition might overlap with the other

00:16.880 --> 00:17.950
category.

00:18.020 --> 00:29.440
But just as a mental framework think of tests as having three main distinct types the first are unit

00:29.440 --> 00:36.190
tests and these are the most common the easiest to implement and the ones that are really important

00:36.190 --> 00:45.510
to have in your application unit tests as the name suggests tests individual functions or classes.

00:45.510 --> 00:53.160
So if I had a sum function I'm going to just test that one function to make sure that it does what it

00:53.160 --> 00:54.000
says it does.

00:54.150 --> 01:02.130
Maybe if it accepts parameter A and B I want to make sure that A and B get added with that function.

01:02.270 --> 01:09.910
They are the cheapest to implement the easiest to implement and 90 percent of your time you're gonna

01:09.950 --> 01:12.300
be working on writing unit tests.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.630
They're very very useful.

01:14.630 --> 01:19.370
The second one is something called integration tests.

01:19.370 --> 01:27.860
This is testing how different pieces of code work together so it can be testing of whether the database

01:28.310 --> 01:33.980
works with the express app that's requesting some data from the database.

01:34.190 --> 01:42.620
Or it could be how a function works with another function and how this connection between them works

01:42.860 --> 01:44.560
and testing that.

01:44.680 --> 01:49.420
Finally we have automation tests or UI tests.

01:49.480 --> 01:56.050
This usually involves testing real life scenarios on the browser by controlling the browser and making

01:56.050 --> 02:00.430
sure that the expected behavior on the web is correct.

02:00.430 --> 02:07.450
Now you can have humans doing this where they go through and click through everything on your Web site

02:07.450 --> 02:14.530
and make sure everything works or you can programmatically have robots or code that you write that runs

02:14.620 --> 02:19.690
through these tests for you as we go down into this order.

02:19.690 --> 02:23.540
They become more and more expensive to implement.

02:23.650 --> 02:24.760
What does that mean.

02:24.760 --> 02:32.080
Well automation tests just by hearing about what they do are a lot more difficult to implement than

02:32.170 --> 02:32.990
unit tests.

02:32.990 --> 02:41.670
Right so all these tests have they use cases but have their pros and cons as well and we're going to

02:41.670 --> 02:47.200
talk about each one of these but for now let's leave it at that.

02:47.340 --> 02:52.140
And in the next video we're going to talk about some of the tools that you're going to encounter as

02:52.140 --> 02:55.480
you start to write tests I'll see in the next one.
