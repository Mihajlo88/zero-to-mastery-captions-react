00:01.540 --> 00:02.760
Welcome back.

00:02.770 --> 00:10.360
Let's use snapshot testing to test some of these other simple presentational components that are completely

00:10.360 --> 00:11.200
stateless.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.230
Since we saw how easy that is.

00:13.450 --> 00:21.240
So let me make this a little bit smaller and make sure we on NPM test to have it running in the background

00:25.770 --> 00:31.730
we see that our test or our car component is being tested now.

00:32.040 --> 00:39.610
So let's create another one let's create a test for the car list component.

00:39.610 --> 00:45.290
Now I'm going to remove the console log here because we don't need it and let's create a car list dot

00:45.290 --> 00:52.190
test file so a card list dot test dot J.S.

00:55.880 --> 01:01.910
and again it's failing because we need to make sure we have at least a single test we can actually go

01:01.910 --> 01:09.080
back to card dot test us and just copy and paste this go to car list component.

01:09.290 --> 01:17.980
Copy and paste whatever we had and just change our component to cordless so let's just do that quickly

01:19.020 --> 01:22.720
we can just select all of these and say card list.

01:23.010 --> 01:28.970
Let me save and we have some fails here.

01:28.990 --> 01:37.880
Let's see why we see that we get a type error cannot read property map of undefined and that is because

01:38.210 --> 01:45.160
card list you see card component is just rendering name and email but it's not doing anything to it.

01:45.170 --> 01:50.920
So if it doesn't get name in email I'll just render undefined when we go to card list.

01:51.080 --> 01:55.990
We see that we're actually receiving the robots and we need to map over them.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.840
But in our test we're a rendering card or.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.190
Let's go to car list.

02:01.190 --> 02:02.120
I'm going to close this.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.370
So we don't get confused.

02:04.370 --> 02:06.200
We're not passing down robots.

02:06.590 --> 02:15.000
So in this test when we try and render card lists it's going to fail because there's no robots to map

02:15.000 --> 02:16.200
over.

02:16.200 --> 02:28.450
So let's fix that all we need to do here is just mock our robots so we can just say const robots or

02:28.450 --> 02:35.590
let's just say mock robots is going to equal an array of some dummy data that we can create.

02:35.590 --> 02:47.560
So let's say that this is going to have an I.D. of one and we'll have the name of John Snow

02:50.510 --> 02:59.560
let's say user name is going to be John John and let's say that email.

02:59.630 --> 03:03.620
I don't think we're using your user name but I wanted to give that user name anyway.

03:03.620 --> 03:08.870
It is going to be John at gmail dot com now.

03:08.990 --> 03:11.510
We can just pass our mock robots

03:15.090 --> 03:17.280
as the robots

03:20.760 --> 03:21.800
so let's see if that works.

03:21.960 --> 03:24.830
I'm going to save all right.

03:24.950 --> 03:33.300
And we have our tests passing and if we go to our snapshot we see that we have a card list snapshot

03:33.360 --> 03:35.020
as well.

03:35.080 --> 03:35.620
That's good.

03:35.620 --> 03:41.860
Our tests failed because we weren't passing robots and while we want to make sure that we actually pass

03:42.070 --> 03:49.660
those properties and you can imagine you can probably do the same thing with card as well or maybe have

03:49.660 --> 03:57.100
a default in this component where if you don't receive name email and I.D. that it has some sort of

03:57.400 --> 04:02.360
an error boundary or an output that it does for the user.

04:02.490 --> 04:12.150
We now see the power of snapshot testing we see how we can mock some of our properties and you might

04:12.450 --> 04:19.290
want to just go ahead and do snapshot testing for some of these other cases that are quite simple to

04:19.290 --> 04:22.020
do to increase our test coverage.

04:22.020 --> 04:28.170
And I'm going to leave that up to you because well just to give you a bit of extra practice so let's

04:28.170 --> 04:33.720
move on to the next video where we do some things that are a little bit more difficult but just the

04:33.720 --> 04:34.200
check.

04:34.650 --> 04:40.980
Let's do our coverage to make sure that our coverage for the car list is now looking good to make this

04:40.980 --> 04:43.980
a little bit bigger and we see that.

04:44.020 --> 04:44.450
Yep.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.450
Look at that.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.720
Feels good getting 100 percent doesn't it.

04:47.750 --> 04:52.910
Carla's component is now well tested as well I'll see in the next one Bye.
