00:00.830 --> 00:01.600
There we have it.

00:01.610 --> 00:02.230
We're done.

00:02.240 --> 00:03.710
We're masters of react now.

00:03.700 --> 00:10.960
We can go off into the world and become the best of reactive Alper ever well not really.

00:11.000 --> 00:11.530
Right.

00:11.540 --> 00:15.330
We just spent a few hours right now just learning the basics of react.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.350
But there is a lot more to learn.

00:18.350 --> 00:21.930
Well we've just done is just scratched the surface.

00:22.010 --> 00:24.950
What I want to do now is do something a little different.

00:25.010 --> 00:32.060
You see right now there's still a few things that we can learn what we would do normally in a course

00:32.120 --> 00:37.680
is just go one by one and keep working on this app and touch on these small projects.

00:37.700 --> 00:40.140
However that's not how real life works.

00:40.160 --> 00:47.030
What we want to do is actually start working on a real life project a big e-commerce project start from

00:47.030 --> 00:53.180
scratch and implement the things that we've learned up until now which are the react fundamentals but

00:53.210 --> 01:00.200
also learn about some of the advanced topics because instead of just going through concepts we want

01:00.200 --> 01:02.460
to mimic real life scenarios.

01:02.540 --> 01:07.790
That is you get thrown into a project that maybe you don't know 100 percent how to build and we're going

01:07.790 --> 01:10.910
to learn and encounter stumbling blocks along the way.

01:10.910 --> 01:19.160
And we're going to use react to learn new concepts but also actually build a real life enterprise project.

01:19.160 --> 01:27.390
If you feel like you haven't mastered react good you definitely haven't because this is just the beginning.

01:27.410 --> 01:29.840
This is when things get interesting.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.320
We're going to start building and we're going to start filling in the gaps that you may have now but

01:35.320 --> 01:41.440
at the same time we want to mimic this real life scenario where you are learning with a senior developer

01:42.160 --> 01:49.250
how to build a project how to architect a project but the key in this section is that we started to

01:49.250 --> 01:52.440
build our fundamentals when it comes to react concepts.

01:52.520 --> 01:58.440
These four fundamentals that by now we should have an understanding of.

01:58.550 --> 02:03.020
We learned about some of the key words so that when we mentioned it throughout the course you wouldn't

02:03.020 --> 02:03.940
be confused.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.700
These are things that we should be comfortable with now.

02:06.980 --> 02:13.070
But more importantly we developed the fundamentals so that moving forward we can start thinking about

02:13.070 --> 02:14.070
these three things.

02:14.090 --> 02:18.620
And I want you to write this down and remember it because it's going to keep coming up throughout the

02:18.620 --> 02:19.510
course.

02:19.790 --> 02:25.970
This idea of deciding on components deciding about the state and where it lists what happens when state

02:25.970 --> 02:31.630
changes because of user action these are all things that nobody is going to tell you.

02:31.670 --> 02:38.480
These are things that is dependent on each app that you built what the senior developers have had this

02:38.480 --> 02:45.590
ability to think for themself not just follow a tutorial but actually implement these things based on

02:45.680 --> 02:48.980
the knowledge and experience that they've gathered.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.730
And because we have the basics now we can gain that experience.

02:53.860 --> 02:56.440
Good job getting through this section.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.040
We have a lot more to cover a lot more coding to go.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.520
I'll see in the next one by.
