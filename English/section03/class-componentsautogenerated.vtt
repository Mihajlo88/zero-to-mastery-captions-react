We know that we can write functions that return HMO but we can also write classes that return HMO.

00:10.030 --> 00:18.310
And the reason why we would want to use a class is because react has given us the ability to write classes

00:18.310 --> 00:24.180
that have a lot more functionality on them versus a function that returns some HMO.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.140
Now let me show you this.

00:26.200 --> 00:38.300
So in order to write a class we've got a first import component from react and instead of this function

00:38.400 --> 00:48.150
and I'm going to convert this into a class so class app extends this component that we get from reactive.

00:48.680 --> 00:56.030
And as a result we now have access to this render method inside of our app class and the render method

00:56.210 --> 00:58.850
returns any HDMI want.

00:58.850 --> 01:06.270
So let's return that HMO we had before inside of our function and we'll see that it's actually the same

01:08.230 --> 01:09.090
and to prove it.

01:09.790 --> 01:11.230
I'm gonna change this tag.

01:11.230 --> 01:14.940
This text here and we should see an update right.

01:15.140 --> 01:17.280
Hello Iowa.

01:17.370 --> 01:24.910
So this is great so it's pretty much the exact same at this point as are functional app that we had

01:25.030 --> 01:26.410
before right.

01:26.410 --> 01:28.640
Our function app that returned this block of H.

01:29.500 --> 01:36.370
But the reason why we would want to use this kind of thing is if we wanted say instead to display this

01:36.370 --> 01:46.200
static string of Hello You are what if I wanted something like let's say instead of an A tag we had

01:46.200 --> 01:55.010
a button and whenever you click this button it would change the text to something else.

01:55.080 --> 01:55.290
Right.

01:55.290 --> 02:05.060
We would change this hello you want to something else well the thing about that is that by using a class

02:05.060 --> 02:13.820
component we actually get access to this thing called state what state is is it some object right.

02:13.970 --> 02:22.550
A javascript object with properties that we can access at any point inside of our class.

02:22.550 --> 02:30.680
And the way we would do this is we would actually call the constructor keyword here and inside of a

02:30.680 --> 02:33.600
constructor we want to call super right.

02:33.800 --> 02:38.330
And what super does is it calls the constructor method on the component class.

02:38.330 --> 02:42.370
And what that does is it gives us access to this dot state right.

02:42.530 --> 02:49.370
This state property now exists on our class app and we can set it to something.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.830
So this is the default value.

02:50.860 --> 02:51.880
I want to set it to first.

02:51.890 --> 02:56.200
So let's say I want to set it to the string that we have right now.

02:56.260 --> 02:56.540
Right.

02:56.660 --> 03:00.520
I want to set some property on our state object too.

03:00.590 --> 03:06.800
Hello Iowa and then I want to render that instead of.

03:06.990 --> 03:07.930
Hello Iowa.

03:07.920 --> 03:08.970
The static string right.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.320
How would I do that.

03:10.320 --> 03:17.570
Well I would first use these curly braces which Jeff Sachs lets us do and it tells the HD and all that.

03:17.570 --> 03:23.060
Anything between these curly braces is going to be JavaScript So I want you to render javascript right.

03:23.610 --> 03:30.660
So we want to do this dot state DOT string and now between these p tags we watch you won't see anything

03:30.660 --> 03:34.180
change because it's the same string but just to.

03:34.190 --> 03:35.490
I want to say hello.

03:35.500 --> 03:43.620
E was saying right there we see that it's looking at the state looking at this property string and rendering

03:43.620 --> 03:50.830
that here instead so that's awesome because now I can do this in multiple places right.

03:50.860 --> 03:58.560
I can use this as many times as I want and I'm going to see multiple versions of it right so what if

03:58.560 --> 04:06.570
I wanted to change this value while the way I would do it is this class app that extends component this

04:06.570 --> 04:14.460
component also gives us this method called set state and what sets state does is it lets us modify this

04:14.460 --> 04:19.380
state object right on every single H html element.

04:19.380 --> 04:28.170
We now have access to this method this property called on click which takes a function that gets called

04:28.710 --> 04:35.950
when ever this element gets clicked so let's pass in this function and in this function we're gonna

04:35.960 --> 04:45.510
say this dot set state and what's that say takes is an object with all of the properties that you want

04:45.510 --> 04:48.480
to change on your state as well as the new values that they have.

04:48.480 --> 04:56.180
So I want to change the property string to Hello Andre.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.700
Now when I click this button it will see that it changed right.

05:02.090 --> 05:07.970
And that's really awesome because this gives us a lot of control over what we want our components to

05:07.970 --> 05:09.470
display.

05:09.560 --> 05:16.760
So this will be really really useful later when we don't know where we're going to get some of the information

05:16.790 --> 05:23.710
that we actually want to display inside of our HCM out but I'm going to show you in the next lesson

05:24.280 --> 05:25.560
why this is really useful.
