Hey it's Andre here.

00:02.590 --> 00:03.980
Just a quick question.

00:04.030 --> 00:09.070
Why do you think we keep breaking things down into components.

00:09.070 --> 00:17.380
I mean in the previous videos we created this card list component that renders this div with something

00:17.380 --> 00:19.080
inside it some children inside it.

00:19.450 --> 00:26.930
And then we broke that down even further to have cards that are being rendered and you might be asking

00:26.930 --> 00:31.490
yourself why exactly is that necessary.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.610
Why can't we just put everything in naptime.

00:33.680 --> 00:41.120
Yes and have just one big well J.S. sex isn't that simpler than dividing everything into all these small

00:41.120 --> 00:43.040
components and so many files.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.430
Isn't that confusing before I answer that question.

00:46.430 --> 00:49.820
I do have a question for you and a little exercise.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.370
When do we break things down into components.

00:53.390 --> 00:59.120
Pause the video here and think about what the benefits are of breaking things down into smaller and

00:59.120 --> 01:04.950
smaller components instead of one big giant one ready for the answer.

01:04.980 --> 01:11.790
Remember this when I told you that to be a great react developer you have to do these three things really

01:11.790 --> 01:12.360
well.

01:12.420 --> 01:19.920
This touches on the first point which is deciding on components and if you remember our example where

01:19.920 --> 01:25.890
we had this little Web site that we broke down into different components remember here and here and

01:25.890 --> 01:30.090
here you can see over here that each part is a component.

01:30.120 --> 01:36.690
Now the reason we would let's say if we had an app like this we wouldn't want to code it all into one

01:36.690 --> 01:44.940
file is that the benefit of React is in the idea of this component architecture that can be placed and

01:44.940 --> 01:47.700
used in multiple locations.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.590
So that means that when we do something like this.

01:52.740 --> 02:00.930
Sure we could have kept all the cards in here without creating a new card component but now this is

02:00.930 --> 02:06.720
more flexible because this card list can now be passed different properties.

02:06.720 --> 02:13.050
For example instead of the monsters maybe we have fairy tale characters in this card list component

02:13.050 --> 02:21.120
can be used on a different project or a different part of the app because it no longer cares what it

02:21.120 --> 02:22.530
prints out.

02:22.530 --> 02:28.650
I mean sure it can print out this card component but maybe we have a fairy tale card component now that

02:28.710 --> 02:32.860
we can just inject into here instead of this card one.

02:32.940 --> 02:39.870
And by breaking things down we're making things more flexible because each component does one thing

02:40.020 --> 02:42.690
and one thing really really well.

02:42.690 --> 02:51.900
So that it can be used in other places the bigger a file gets the more J.S. sex we have the more logic

02:51.930 --> 02:55.650
we have the harder it gets to be used in another place.

02:55.830 --> 03:01.810
And this idea of breaking things down into small individual chunks is really really important.

03:01.950 --> 03:11.910
And most good react projects break things down into a pretty small component file that the name pretty

03:11.910 --> 03:13.840
much tells it exactly what it does.

03:13.860 --> 03:22.440
Just one small thing and the other benefit that we will also encounter later on is that we also have

03:22.440 --> 03:29.520
this flexibility of performance improvements potentially as well as having components that are really

03:29.520 --> 03:32.000
easy to test because they're so simple.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.590
Now those are topics that will uncover later on.

03:35.400 --> 03:41.130
But the key here is that the reason we break things down into smaller and smaller components is that

03:41.130 --> 03:48.570
we combine each component with its concern and that concern is that this component is only concerned

03:48.570 --> 03:49.920
about card list.

03:49.950 --> 03:53.720
This component is only concerned about cards.

03:53.850 --> 03:56.640
Now this is an idea that we're going to explore throughout our course.

03:56.640 --> 04:00.390
So if you don't get it 100 percent don't worry we still have lots to cover.

04:00.870 --> 04:01.580
So let's keep going.
