Hey welcome back.

00:02.280 --> 00:04.130
I just want to add a quick note here.

00:04.200 --> 00:09.100
I've actually ejected a create react app just to show you what happens.

00:09.240 --> 00:14.750
You'll see here that it gives me a folder called scripts and then a folder called config.

00:15.230 --> 00:16.210
And in here.

00:16.230 --> 00:21.570
Well this was everything that the create react app was hiding underneath the hood for us.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.670
You had things like just that was using for tests.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.430
We have our Web pack configuration and remember our module bundler.

00:28.440 --> 00:35.900
You can see over here how long and intense and complicated it looks but we also have all the scripts

00:36.200 --> 00:43.330
that were run for example when we ran NPM Ram build or NPM run start or test.

00:43.610 --> 00:46.480
You see over here that it's quite a lot of code.

00:46.520 --> 00:53.450
This is why I recommend not ejecting because no matter what no matter how much time you spend with react

00:53.750 --> 01:00.560
you were never going to compete with the developers that are working full time trying to make create

01:00.560 --> 01:01.440
react app.

01:01.490 --> 01:08.540
The best tool possible developers that are getting paid to make this tool as easy and as efficient for

01:08.540 --> 01:09.350
you.

01:09.530 --> 01:14.980
So I recommend that you never eject out of create react app unless you absolutely have to.

01:15.170 --> 01:23.660
Because by using create react app we automatically get the best system and project build out of the

01:23.660 --> 01:24.210
box.

01:24.230 --> 01:30.500
And anytime there are updates or the industry changes and there's new ways of doing things create react

01:30.500 --> 01:38.560
app is automatically well going to have new version that has those changes implemented by professionals.

01:38.570 --> 01:44.120
So again I wanted to show you that this is what's happening underneath the hood but ninety nine point

01:44.120 --> 01:50.180
nine percent of the time you don't really need to eject because you lose all the benefits as create

01:50.180 --> 01:54.260
react app gets more and more updates.

01:54.440 --> 01:56.060
I'll see in the next one by.
