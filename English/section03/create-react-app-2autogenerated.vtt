WEBVTT

00:00.360 --> 00:04.200
Now let's take a look at what create react app has made for us.

00:04.590 --> 00:11.900
SO WE'RE GONNA GO INTO OUR MONSTER'S Rolodex and if we hit unless we see that it's actually generated

00:11.900 --> 00:17.870
this project for us it's got all our dependencies inside of node modules and it's got a package Jason

00:17.930 --> 00:20.850
and then some of these other file folders and files.

00:20.870 --> 00:25.740
So now if we open that up and take a look let's look at the package.

00:25.750 --> 00:32.500
Jason first we see that it's included for us react and react Dom which is great as well as this other

00:32.500 --> 00:34.410
library called react scripts.

00:35.220 --> 00:40.770
Now what react scripts does for us is it's what makes create react app so great.

00:40.770 --> 00:47.150
It's actually what allows us to have to not worry about web pack and babble.

00:47.380 --> 00:53.350
It includes these four scripts for us and it calls that library react scripts to do these four things

00:53.800 --> 00:57.620
start build test and eject.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.580
Now what start does is it actually starts the project.

01:01.660 --> 01:09.970
So let's try that first so if we call yarn start we act scripts start right there.

01:10.150 --> 01:17.050
And what this does is it serves up this sample application of react inside of our local host which is

01:17.050 --> 01:17.790
pretty awesome.

01:17.800 --> 01:20.530
We have a working react app right away.

01:20.530 --> 01:23.390
If we look at the next one built.

01:23.530 --> 01:27.850
So before we start looking at the script let's actually look at these two folders.

01:28.090 --> 01:34.880
Now the source folder is actually where our application lives all of the real code that we write for

01:34.880 --> 01:38.800
our application is going to go into the source folder.

01:38.800 --> 01:46.630
This public folder is actually where all those files that I mentioned earlier where our browser needs

01:46.630 --> 01:50.980
an older version of JavaScript and him all to understand.

01:51.010 --> 01:53.670
So while this is actually the folder where all that's going to go.

01:54.130 --> 02:01.360
So when we call this build script what create racked up I was gonna do is it's going to turn all of

02:01.360 --> 02:07.480
the react code in our source folder into that version that the browser understands and put it inside

02:07.480 --> 02:15.810
of this public folder test just runs the test code that we're gonna write and then eject will actually

02:16.500 --> 02:22.920
take out all of the configuration files that it's hidden from us for Babylon web hack in case we wanted

02:22.920 --> 02:26.580
to manage it ourselves now.

02:26.770 --> 02:31.970
Now that we understand what the basics of what create react app has done for us here.

02:32.020 --> 02:34.630
Let's actually look at some of the code.

02:34.710 --> 02:39.330
Now the first thing I want us to look at is this app dot J.S. file.

02:39.330 --> 02:46.230
Now I know this looks a little overwhelming but let's just take it line by line so first we're going

02:46.230 --> 02:49.710
to import all the things from react that we need.

02:49.880 --> 02:51.080
And it's called react right.

02:51.080 --> 02:56.930
We import react from react and that's going to hold everything related to react that we need inside

02:57.140 --> 03:06.230
into this file then we're going to import the logo from logo dot SPG which is essentially just this

03:06.290 --> 03:17.930
logo image then we're going to import the CSX and now let's look at the actual meat of this file let's

03:17.930 --> 03:19.550
look at line 5.

03:19.610 --> 03:24.320
This is just a function called app that returns a block of H Timo.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.180
That's all it is.

03:26.210 --> 03:32.860
So everything that we see here is actually just the HDMI here.

03:32.860 --> 03:41.700
Now how this works is that when we look at this index such as file we see that we import that app function

03:41.760 --> 03:43.480
that we were just looking at.

03:43.740 --> 03:52.080
And then there's this react on library that calls render and then it renders our app function in the

03:52.080 --> 03:54.310
form of what looks like an HDMI tag.

03:54.450 --> 03:54.780
Right.

03:55.410 --> 04:00.600
And then you see this thing here that says document dot yet element by idea of root.

04:00.630 --> 04:09.840
So what this is is it's looking on the document object for some elements with an idea of root and it's

04:09.840 --> 04:15.670
replacing it with this function that we saw that returns HMO.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.550
So it's going to replace that element with the idea of root with all of that age them out from our function

04:21.610 --> 04:30.550
and where that div is with the idea of root is inside of index relational inside of this body tag is

04:30.550 --> 04:37.490
a single div with the idea of root and this is the entry way for our application.

04:37.650 --> 04:47.520
It's essentially just this library replacing that div with the idea of root with our function that returns

04:48.090 --> 04:50.750
some HMO.

04:50.780 --> 04:59.930
Now one of the great things about create react app is that if we make any changes to any of our files

05:00.560 --> 05:04.570
it'll automatically update inside of our local host.

05:04.580 --> 05:13.440
So if I wanted to change this to say hello my name is e Hua we will automatically see this update.

05:13.610 --> 05:18.620
And that's really awesome because that means that we don't have to worry about refreshing anything we

05:18.620 --> 05:22.130
just code and see those changes like.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.050
Now let's get started with actually converting this into this.
