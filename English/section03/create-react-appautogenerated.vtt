00:00.890 --> 00:05.310
So let's get started with our first react app.

00:05.340 --> 00:10.560
The first thing we're going to build is this application called Monster's roll attacks.

00:10.560 --> 00:14.610
It's a web app that has these cards that have monsters in them.

00:14.700 --> 00:20.610
And these cards have a name and an email and then there's also this search box that we can use to filter

00:20.610 --> 00:25.850
out the monsters by what we type in now through building this application.

00:25.850 --> 00:33.600
We are going to understand the basics of what react does how to write react code and also some of the

00:33.600 --> 00:41.310
fundamental things we need to understand when building an application and react before we get started.

00:41.310 --> 00:49.500
We're going to use a tool called Create react app create react app is a tool that was built by Facebook

00:49.860 --> 00:56.100
to help developers get started with building react projects very quickly.

00:56.100 --> 01:05.400
The reason for this tool is because react is actually written in a version of JavaScript that is further

01:05.520 --> 01:11.280
along than the version of JavaScript that our browsers understand.

01:11.280 --> 01:18.240
So there are actually these two tools called Babel and web pack that take the react code that we write

01:18.690 --> 01:26.940
and convert them into that older version of JavaScript and HD email that our browser is able to understand.

01:26.970 --> 01:33.660
Now the Facebook team understood that it would be a lot of work for new developers in order to learn

01:33.660 --> 01:40.870
REACT TO LEARN ALL THIS CONFIGURATION regarding web pack and Babel if they just want to write react.

01:40.900 --> 01:45.930
Then there should be a quick way just to start writing a react project.

01:45.960 --> 01:52.920
So this tool helps us spin up a project that already has all this configuration done for us.

01:53.700 --> 02:02.010
Now later on in the course I will definitely show you guys how create react app works under the hood.

02:02.010 --> 02:05.720
I'm going to show you some of the web pack and some of the Babel.

02:05.730 --> 02:12.990
So you understand how to do it yourself but right now I just want us to start learning react now in

02:12.990 --> 02:14.370
order to use this tool.

02:14.430 --> 02:20.930
We see that we got a call NPM create react app and then the name of our application in our command line

02:22.250 --> 02:26.870
so before we begin we got to make sure we're using the latest version of node.

02:27.050 --> 02:33.380
So if we check the node Web site we'll see that the latest stable recommended version is ten point one

02:33.380 --> 02:34.880
five point three.

02:34.880 --> 02:42.560
So let's go to our terminal and I use end VM so I'm gonna call envy them install ten point one five

02:42.560 --> 02:52.560
point three and end VM will install this version of node and then we're gonna use it and VM use ten

02:52.560 --> 02:56.530
point one five point three.

02:56.540 --> 03:05.930
Now we're going to call what we saw earlier NDP X create react app monster's Rolodex

03:08.640 --> 03:14.550
now create react app is now building out our project and setting up the files.

03:14.610 --> 03:23.270
The Web hack the Babel all the stuff we need so that we can start using react right away and after this

03:23.270 --> 03:30.710
project gets built let's C.D. into it and then let's see what create react app gives us.
