Hey it's Andre here.

00:02.860 --> 00:09.050
Some of you might be wondering why we don't add state to search box.

00:09.070 --> 00:16.810
I mean it looks like what we're doing is adding the on change over here giving it a function and this

00:16.810 --> 00:24.970
function goes up a level and letting our app just know that there was an event but search box.

00:24.970 --> 00:29.320
Shouldn't that have these search field state.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.460
Let's explore that.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.760
Now I want you to think about this.

00:32.830 --> 00:37.880
Why wouldn't we put state here positive video.

00:37.880 --> 00:38.750
Think about it.

00:38.810 --> 00:40.990
Let's find out why.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.090
Remember our third point over here.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.800
A good reactive upper decide.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.220
Decides what changes when state changes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.450
Let's think about this.

00:51.690 --> 00:59.400
Now the reason we don't change the state in search box and instead we trigger whenever an event happens

00:59.790 --> 01:07.830
to handle change up here an app J.S. is because our other component card list needs to have that information

01:07.980 --> 01:08.520
right.

01:08.520 --> 01:16.410
Remember the way we filtered monsters was by using the search field state to filter based on the user

01:16.410 --> 01:23.060
input so the way to think about this is like so if we had our app over here and this is our app.

01:23.110 --> 01:23.720
Yes.

01:23.810 --> 01:33.980
And in here we have the search component and the card list component if the state was only here in the

01:33.980 --> 01:35.290
search box component.

01:35.290 --> 01:39.290
There's no way for the car list component to find out about it.

01:39.330 --> 01:44.350
Remember because of one way data flow data can only flow one way.

01:44.500 --> 01:51.960
So there's no way for let's say the search field state to move up and down to the car list component.

01:52.750 --> 02:00.690
So instead we want to place the state in a place where it gives us access to whatever needs it.

02:00.790 --> 02:05.920
In our case both card list and search box need that state.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.270
That search field state.

02:07.360 --> 02:15.520
So we move it up and the way we architect things and react is that when an event happens on a component

02:16.400 --> 02:19.520
let's say a user clicks or type something.

02:19.720 --> 02:27.610
Well that event triggers the react event system and says Hey something else happened create an event

02:27.610 --> 02:37.270
handler like handle input or handle change and it's going to go up and let the component that has that

02:37.270 --> 02:43.240
state know that hey something else happened you need to update state and how far up that goes.

02:43.240 --> 02:49.540
Let's say we had a component underneath this we notify the component that has the state as far up as

02:49.540 --> 02:55.870
we need to in order to pass down that information to the components that need that information.

02:55.990 --> 02:58.480
Now if you don't get this right away don't worry.

02:58.510 --> 03:03.250
This is something that comes with practice that we're going to explore throughout the course as we build

03:03.250 --> 03:04.360
more and more projects.

03:04.390 --> 03:12.100
But I want you to pay attention that you want to decide as a reactive helper what changes what events

03:12.130 --> 03:14.350
that the users take.

03:14.380 --> 03:22.090
How far up it goes to let the state know and you want to move the state in a high enough position so

03:22.090 --> 03:26.770
that we are still able to pass down that information to different nodes.

03:26.770 --> 03:35.100
But at the same time if we had let's say a state in here that the only people that care about it is

03:35.220 --> 03:37.230
these two components.

03:37.230 --> 03:41.850
Well if that's the case there's no point bringing up the state all the way up here.

03:41.910 --> 03:47.250
You want to place the state over here because all these components don't really care about any of this.

03:47.280 --> 03:53.760
Again this is a topic that will cover a lot more and structuring state is a very big topic and yet but

03:53.760 --> 03:57.480
I want you to start noticing these things let's keep going.
