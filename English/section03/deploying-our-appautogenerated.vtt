WEBVTT

00:01.830 --> 00:07.650
Now that we've created our card component our card list component and our search box component we're

00:07.650 --> 00:11.340
pretty much done with the most of the functionality in this application.

00:11.340 --> 00:14.910
The only thing we're missing is a little bit of styling.

00:14.910 --> 00:17.490
So the first thing we need is to add this title.

00:17.820 --> 00:24.420
And I'm just gonna add it as an H1 here at the top of our apple J.S. Johnson's Rolodex

00:27.970 --> 00:31.740
and then we need that font because you'll see that we don't have this font.

00:31.750 --> 00:38.820
Now this font we can get from Google fonts fonts Doc Google dot com and we can see all these different

00:38.820 --> 00:42.510
fonts that Google allows us to use in our project.

00:42.540 --> 00:45.760
So I'm just gonna find the one we want cut Bigelow rules.

00:45.900 --> 00:53.280
I'm gonna hit this a little plus and Google gives us a link that we can add to our index that each symbol

00:54.360 --> 00:56.530
inside of our head.

00:56.720 --> 01:04.530
We just added at the bottom here and now we have access to Bigelow rules in our project now.

01:04.550 --> 01:12.730
If we go to opt out see SS I'm going to add a new rule for H1 and I'm going to say font family is Bigelow

01:12.730 --> 01:18.400
rule.

01:18.470 --> 01:27.680
I'm also going to set the font size to 70 two pixel and the color and now if we look we'll see that

01:27.680 --> 01:33.350
our project has the same font now which is really awesome because Google has this great font service

01:33.350 --> 01:34.630
for us.

01:34.730 --> 01:40.760
So now what we need is the background the background we're gonna put into our index that CSX and this

01:40.760 --> 01:43.480
is a file that gets generated by create react.

01:44.150 --> 01:50.600
The reason why they've already added this styling to the body and the code is because create react app

01:50.690 --> 01:58.490
wants the exact same base styling across all browsers so different browsers might run different things

01:58.490 --> 02:06.170
like a different font or a different margin or padding so create react app is just trying to equalize

02:06.170 --> 02:13.610
that when the project starts but inside of this body we're just going to add this linear gradient to

02:13.610 --> 02:14.170
our background

02:16.860 --> 02:18.740
and you can make any gradient you want.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.450
I just made this one and we'll see.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.280
Our project is finished just like that.

02:25.280 --> 02:33.370
We've built a project that has filtering and we understand now how components are created now that we

02:33.370 --> 02:35.140
finish building our website.

02:35.170 --> 02:42.430
It's actually not live yet but we can actually host this really easily using get hub pages so create

02:42.430 --> 02:49.810
react app has made it really easy to use the github pages service and get hub lets us host static web

02:49.810 --> 02:54.310
sites for free which is really awesome and it's actually really easy.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.790
There's just a couple steps we got to take.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.980
The first one we've got to do is we have to go to get hub

03:03.710 --> 03:07.670
and then we have to make a new repository.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.870
Now I'm going to name my repository monster's rolodex.

03:10.870 --> 03:12.100
After that our project

03:15.290 --> 03:17.770
and then I'm gonna copy this key.

03:18.050 --> 03:25.350
This SSA key right here I'm gonna go to our terminal and then I'm going to do two things.

03:25.370 --> 03:30.790
First I'm going to connect our actual project to that repository.

03:30.800 --> 03:38.620
We've just made by doing get remote add origin and then that Kiwi copied.

03:38.850 --> 03:45.930
Next I'm going to actually include the g h pages package by doing yarn add g h pages

03:49.740 --> 03:54.820
next I'm gonna go to our package not chase on file and I'm gonna do two things.

03:55.650 --> 04:02.720
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add home page.

04:03.070 --> 04:13.860
I'm gonna actually type in HDTV s dash dash Zang m e Hwa which is the name of my github username.

04:13.860 --> 04:20.010
So you're gonna use your GitHub username here and you're gonna do get hub dot Io slash and then the

04:20.010 --> 04:23.830
name of the project that we made on GetUp.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.840
The name of that repository for me it's monster's Rolodex.

04:27.840 --> 04:33.100
The one we just created then I'm going to add two scripts.

04:33.440 --> 04:41.180
The first one is called Redeploy and in this pre deploy I'm just going to call build because as we remember

04:41.240 --> 04:47.060
our build script builds all of our real code into the final code that our browser needs.

04:47.060 --> 04:56.770
And then I'm gonna call deploy and this one I'm going to say G H pages dash D built.

04:56.880 --> 05:03.390
Now this is gonna run pre deploy before it runs deploy which is really awesome because NPM and Jaan

05:03.390 --> 05:10.260
both know to run any script that you have pre with before you run the actual script.

05:10.260 --> 05:14.790
So it's gonna run pre deploy before it runs deploy and then it's going to serve up that two arc yet

05:14.790 --> 05:16.110
hub project.

05:16.110 --> 05:25.220
Now we're gonna go back to our terminal and then we're gonna run our new deploy script and now we actually

05:25.220 --> 05:32.180
see it runs our pre deploy script first and then we're gonna see that it actually runs our deploy script

05:32.270 --> 05:33.940
right after.

05:34.200 --> 05:39.540
Now this is going to build all of our project files that we need for the final project and then we're

05:39.540 --> 05:49.340
going to add and then we're gonna write a command message adding files for get hub pages and now we're

05:49.340 --> 05:50.360
going to push this up

05:53.250 --> 05:59.880
so once this is all pushed up now to our final project repository we're gonna go back to our Get hub

06:00.630 --> 06:02.270
and we're gonna refresh.

06:02.330 --> 06:11.570
Right now we should see all our files in here and if we now go to the settings and when we scroll down

06:11.990 --> 06:16.070
we want to make sure that the source is actually pointing to get hub pages branch.

06:16.070 --> 06:20.160
If you're just pointing to master just make sure to set it to get hub pages branch.

06:20.390 --> 06:25.200
And now if we go to our link we see our website is live.

06:25.200 --> 06:31.060
It's actually served at this URL and that's awesome because get hub lets us serve these static websites

06:31.110 --> 06:37.740
for free very easily and very quickly and you can see how if you wanted to build a quick static web

06:37.740 --> 06:48.120
site using react it's really easy to build it and then serve it using create react app and get out pages.

06:48.180 --> 06:56.190
Now when we actually build our final application which is a very more dynamic e-commerce Web site we're

06:56.190 --> 07:02.370
going to actually use databases and we're going to leverage a lot more code that won't get help won't

07:02.370 --> 07:03.890
be enough for us to serve.

07:03.990 --> 07:07.710
And I'm going to show you how we're gonna take all of these things that we learned.

07:07.710 --> 07:16.500
Building this application and then expand upon them in that lesson so I hope you enjoyed this and look

07:16.500 --> 07:20.910
forward to building your first big react project.
