00:00.390 --> 00:02.190
Welcome back everyone.

00:02.190 --> 00:08.850
So in this lesson we are just going to add some finishing touches to our blog code so our index J.S.

00:08.910 --> 00:15.840
we currently need to sort the actual blog posts themselves so that their order is more based on the

00:15.840 --> 00:20.080
date having the latest be the ones at the top.

00:20.100 --> 00:27.630
Now how we can do this is we can actually use a sort method the sort method is inside of graph QR as

00:27.630 --> 00:34.350
well and as a allows us to sort by some specific field value and in our case the one that we want to

00:34.350 --> 00:42.440
sort off of is our fronts matter underscore underscore underscore date and the order that we want it

00:42.440 --> 00:45.030
to be in is descending order.

00:45.030 --> 00:49.540
Now if this is confusing you can actually see this as well inside of graph Q well.

00:49.560 --> 00:58.720
So if we were to take our all mark down remarks and here we check to sort it inside of here we see on

00:58.720 --> 01:04.870
our sort that we sort by some field and if the field that we want to sort by is date what we have to

01:04.870 --> 01:10.300
do is say that it's based off a front matter date you see right here this autocomplete underscore underscore

01:10.320 --> 01:10.880
date.

01:11.110 --> 01:17.360
That's how we access a property that sits inside of an object on the field now.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.050
After this we want to sort by the order and we can do descending or ascending.

01:22.070 --> 01:23.660
So that's what it is.

01:23.660 --> 01:29.420
So by this automatically now this is sorted by descending order we can double check by checking the

01:29.480 --> 01:30.040
front matter.

01:30.050 --> 01:30.800
Date value

01:33.950 --> 01:36.710
and now we see that the latest ones are at the top.

01:36.760 --> 01:37.770
So that's all we're doing here.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.380
We're just sorting this by this order now that we have all of the data.

01:42.390 --> 01:48.180
The other thing that we want to do is be able to link to our pages from these components.

01:48.180 --> 01:54.210
So what we can do is we can also pluck off the fields and grab the slug from the note itself because

01:54.210 --> 02:00.880
as we know we've added it in now one other thing that we might want to do is actually style this page

02:00.910 --> 02:06.210
so that it looks a little better the way that I'm going to suggest you do it is with style components

02:06.340 --> 02:11.410
but you can totally do it with any other styling that you're comfortable with inside of react.

02:11.410 --> 02:19.330
So in order to actually add in style components to Gatsby there is a Gatsby plugin that allows us to

02:19.390 --> 02:22.480
add stock components really easily to our Gatsby folder.

02:23.020 --> 02:29.440
So what we'll do is we will let's just cancel our server first and just like before using the package

02:29.440 --> 02:31.700
manager that you've been using up until now.

02:31.840 --> 02:38.590
For you it's either yarn or or NPM I'm using yarn just add in these three packages so I'm going to say

02:38.590 --> 02:47.320
yarn add Gatsby plug in styled components which is the Gatsby plug in first thought components we need

02:47.320 --> 02:48.790
styled components itself.

02:48.850 --> 02:58.760
So this is the star components library and then I need the babble plug in styled components so we need

02:58.760 --> 03:03.080
these three in order to properly run stock components inside of our application.

03:03.080 --> 03:11.540
And once it's finished installing what we're going to do is modify our Gatsby config so that it includes

03:11.630 --> 03:17.190
our Gatsby stock components plug in and all we do is we just add it somewhere here.

03:17.370 --> 03:26.410
I'm just gonna put it right here and it's going to be our Gatsby plug in styled components and now we're

03:26.410 --> 03:29.470
able to load style components into our application.

03:29.470 --> 03:35.080
So what I want to do is write stock components for my index J.S. now in order to use stock components

03:35.140 --> 03:37.340
we just need to bring it in.

03:37.480 --> 03:47.420
So we are going to import in styled import in styled from style components and then what we're going

03:47.420 --> 03:51.810
to write is we are going to make our blog link.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.680
So we've imported in the slug we now actually need to allow our title to be clickable in that way.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.650
Now the first document I'm going to make is a blog link.

04:01.250 --> 04:06.650
So this is pretty much just us using these style component library wrapping around the link component

04:06.650 --> 04:14.060
that we get from Gatsby and what I'm going to say is I want to apply the styling of having no text decoration

04:14.600 --> 04:19.460
the reason for this is because the link is actually just an A tag with some modifications on it.

04:19.910 --> 04:25.060
So in our case I don't want any of these styling that comes with an attack.

04:25.250 --> 04:35.020
After that I'm going to use it to actually just wrap around the actual span tag that we have here so

04:35.020 --> 04:46.910
I'm just gonna put in my blog link and this is just going to navigate us to our node fields dot slug.

04:46.930 --> 04:54.810
So now our blog link actually points us to our slug field that we have after that I'm going to make

04:54.880 --> 05:02.890
another one called blog title and this blog title is just going to be a styled H3

05:06.070 --> 05:12.370
and on this component I am going to put a let's just say a margin bottom of 20

05:16.630 --> 05:17.910
let's actually make it blue as well.

05:17.920 --> 05:23.170
Just so that we can see the changes and then I'm going to replace this span with it.

05:23.260 --> 05:30.630
Now if I save and we go back to our application we'll see that our links are now clickable and they

05:30.630 --> 05:37.270
take us to our respective blog post that's pretty much all that we need to do in order to actually build

05:37.270 --> 05:38.580
out our blog.

05:38.620 --> 05:42.500
Now the last thing that you might want to do is host this somehow.

05:42.870 --> 05:48.610
Gatsby is actually really great with a another service called Net Lafite net VI allows us to host static

05:48.610 --> 05:52.210
web sites and get continuous development pretty much for free.

05:52.210 --> 05:58.260
And the easiest way to do that is you just first instantiate a get hub repo that you put your code into.

05:58.510 --> 06:06.870
So you can make a new repo and I'm just going to call it new Gatsby block.

06:07.010 --> 06:09.250
I am going to just copy this key.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.170
So if you don't have access H that I'll just use HDTV yes.

06:12.320 --> 06:21.840
It's about the same and then I'm just going to make sure to run get ad dash a get commit adding all

06:23.740 --> 06:35.590
our new blog code for Gatsby set up and then I'm going to get ad remote origin and then paste in that

06:36.070 --> 06:44.050
key that we just copy upside get remote ad origin and then paste that key so now that we have a remote

06:44.050 --> 06:48.910
origin I'm going to run get push origin master with the new code that we have

06:52.920 --> 06:58.180
and now that we have the setup what we're going to do is we simply go to net Lafite.

06:58.650 --> 07:04.380
Now on net Lafite you have to sign up if you haven't signed up just make sure to do so once you've signed

07:04.380 --> 07:06.390
up just make a log in.

07:06.390 --> 07:10.560
And now it's so incredibly easy to actually set this up.

07:10.650 --> 07:15.510
So what you need to do is just make sure that your code is actually on the new site that you've got

07:15.630 --> 07:16.860
in your repo.

07:16.860 --> 07:20.180
So we see that my code is now inside of my new Gatsby blog repo.

07:20.830 --> 07:25.740
And what I'm going to do is just click this new site from get I'm going to select get hub for the continuous

07:25.740 --> 07:30.150
deployment option and it's going to ask to authorize me.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.920
Now you probably have to allow it to authorize you to connect to your GitHub and what you're gonna do

07:34.920 --> 07:38.100
is just find the name of your actual repo

07:41.490 --> 07:42.270
once you have it.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.380
You click it by default.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.290
All of these settings should be good.

07:46.350 --> 07:48.110
It's gonna run the Gatsby build.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.880
And once you click deploy that's it.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.900
It's in the process of building and deploying your Web site.

07:54.090 --> 07:59.490
And once your Web site's finished it's going to give you the actual link that tells you what your site

07:59.520 --> 08:00.530
is hosted to.

08:00.540 --> 08:04.870
So let's just wait for our Web site to finish deploying OK.

08:04.900 --> 08:08.310
So now that it's finished we see that we get our you url.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.570
We simply click it.

08:09.850 --> 08:17.540
And now we are live with our blog so if you actually want to make any changes it's super easy because

08:17.570 --> 08:22.250
all you do is you just write the code you push to get hub and automatically getting Natalya firewall

08:22.300 --> 08:24.740
restart and reboot and redeploy your Web site.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.450
So here I actually didn't add in any posts.

08:27.450 --> 08:33.200
So what I'm gonna do right here is I'm just going to add the word posts.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.620
I'm going to save.

08:34.640 --> 08:39.990
I'm going to get and added word posts.

08:40.180 --> 08:48.880
I'm going to push and once this pushes up to my github again if you go back to Natalya Fei you might

08:48.880 --> 08:55.030
actually see when you scroll down here and production deploys that there's this new second tab for another

08:55.030 --> 08:55.860
production.

08:55.930 --> 09:01.270
So this is actually a list of all of the deployments that are being made now yours might say include

09:01.300 --> 09:03.010
or it might see in progress.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.120
Mine just got published.

09:04.150 --> 09:08.050
So now if I go back to my blog and I refresh I see the word up there.

09:08.050 --> 09:13.210
So this is awesome because identify just immediately gives you tenuous development right off the gate

09:13.210 --> 09:16.290
with your get hub account and it was so simple to setup.

09:16.390 --> 09:22.240
So with this you pretty much have your blog all the code is written you can pretty much use stock components

09:22.240 --> 09:27.220
or any other styling system you want and tackle the coding challenge as you please.

09:27.220 --> 09:28.560
So good luck everybody.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.150
And I hope you enjoyed this lesson on how to use Gatsby.
