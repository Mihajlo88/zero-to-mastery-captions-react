00:00.330 --> 00:02.140
Welcome back everyone.

00:02.160 --> 00:09.090
In the last lesson we learned how to hook into this on create node method inside of our Gatsby no J.S.

00:09.690 --> 00:15.390
This method allowed us to hook into the build process when Gatsby would go through our files and build

00:15.390 --> 00:21.960
out the individual node representations of them and then we were specifically looking for nodes of the

00:21.960 --> 00:24.480
type of markdown remark.

00:24.480 --> 00:30.840
We then added this new node field on it equal to slug and the slug pointed to the new file path that

00:30.840 --> 00:31.950
we've made.

00:31.950 --> 00:39.690
So now that we've modified these markdown nodes we have the actual slug value that we can access inside

00:39.750 --> 00:41.230
of our application.

00:41.340 --> 00:47.700
And in this lesson we actually need to use that because we're going to build out the final pages that

00:47.760 --> 00:54.690
are markdowns represent inside of our website that point to the actual blog posts that we want the users

00:54.690 --> 00:55.830
to see.

00:55.830 --> 01:03.170
So just like we saw with our pages folder which had any files that we wanted to represent as the final

01:03.170 --> 01:07.780
page that our users could see we're going to do the same thing with our markdown files.

01:09.230 --> 01:14.610
So one thing that we have to know is that we have to use a another method inside of our Gatsby No j

01:14.610 --> 01:21.430
s I'm going to give you documentation to this API so that you can see any other methods you can access

01:21.650 --> 01:26.020
and you can also look up anything that we've already used before to get a better understanding of it.

01:26.690 --> 01:35.080
But the next one we're going to use is called create pages and create pages gets two arguments that

01:35.080 --> 01:40.960
we wanted to structure off the first one is just graphed you all which is pretty much the same way that

01:40.960 --> 01:46.540
we've made graph Q all queries before we can just now do so inside of our No j s and the other thing

01:46.540 --> 01:50.170
we get is actions.

01:50.250 --> 01:57.540
Now what we're going to pull off of these actions is the method create page create page is an action

01:57.810 --> 02:06.060
that allows us to actually build the pages inside of our application based on whatever properties we

02:06.060 --> 02:09.900
pass to it that will discover once we actually use it.

02:09.920 --> 02:16.190
So what we want to actually return from our create pages function right here though is we want to return

02:16.340 --> 02:21.510
a graph to a query that gives us back all of our markdown remarks.

02:21.770 --> 02:29.200
Then we're going to iterate over it and simply just call create page on each of those markdown notes.

02:29.330 --> 02:34.170
So in order for us to do this we have to use the graph Q all query that we got back.

02:34.400 --> 02:40.010
So to use it we're just going to say graph Q Well and then we're gonna pass it with these parentheses

02:41.050 --> 02:47.860
now if you're curious as to why inside of here we have to use these parentheses whereas inside of our

02:47.860 --> 02:49.610
front end react applications.

02:49.630 --> 02:50.570
We don't.

02:50.680 --> 02:58.090
This is because there's a new template syntax in iOS 6 that allows you to pass template literal strings

02:58.870 --> 03:00.860
like this in the front end.

03:00.910 --> 03:06.310
As long as you have access to iOS 6 which is pretty much equivalent to doing this there's really no

03:06.310 --> 03:07.120
difference.

03:07.360 --> 03:11.680
But because with no JSA we do not get iOS 6 features right out jump.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.100
We do not have access to writing it this way.

03:15.190 --> 03:19.450
So we have to pass these parentheses just if you're curious as to why here we have to do it.

03:19.480 --> 03:23.350
So that's just one thing you have to remember if you ever use the graph queue I'll query inside of your

03:23.350 --> 03:24.550
note jazz.

03:24.550 --> 03:31.060
Now there are setups that you can do with no jazz and express so that you do get to use that same syntax

03:31.090 --> 03:33.430
as you are familiar with in your front end.

03:33.610 --> 03:39.130
But in our case it's not necessary it's extra work that really just to avoid adding these parentheses

03:39.550 --> 03:40.300
is not worth it.

03:41.770 --> 03:44.070
But now that we have our graph you query it.

03:44.080 --> 03:51.250
We have to make the actual query for our all markdown remarks so we're going to do this inside of our

03:51.250 --> 03:53.710
graphical just so we can actually see this.

03:53.860 --> 03:59.020
So inside of your playground what you're gonna do is you are going to click all marked down remark.

03:59.170 --> 04:01.120
We want the edges.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.000
We want the note from these edges.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.280
We want the fields and off these fields we want the slug.

04:05.320 --> 04:11.980
If we fire off this request we see that this is going to be the object we get back we're going to need

04:11.980 --> 04:18.820
to pull off this edges array and iterate over this so that we can call create page using each of these

04:18.820 --> 04:23.280
node objects to build the actual page because this holds the data that we need.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.240
So let's just copy over our query object.

04:26.260 --> 04:32.410
We'll go back to our code and just paste this in now graph Q Well the method will simply return as a

04:32.410 --> 04:36.100
result inside of a promise.

04:36.130 --> 04:43.870
So once this resolves we just call dot then on it and we will get the result value and off of that result

04:43.870 --> 04:45.640
value it will be that shape that we saw.

04:45.790 --> 04:52.700
So we want to look at the data and off the data we want are all marked down remark and all our markdown

04:52.710 --> 04:55.830
remark we want the edges array.

04:55.830 --> 05:01.860
So we just want to loop over this array with for each and for every element inside we want to pluck

05:01.860 --> 05:03.920
off the note because that's all we need

05:06.820 --> 05:14.200
now with this node we are going to call create page and we're going to pass create page a object and

05:14.200 --> 05:19.780
this object is going to define the properties that this create page needs in order to actually build

05:19.810 --> 05:21.310
out the page that we're looking for.

05:21.310 --> 05:27.820
So the first thing it needs is the path the path will tell it in the final application what path actually

05:27.880 --> 05:29.780
leads to this page that I'm building.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.710
And this is where we're going to use our slug.

05:32.710 --> 05:38.800
So we're gonna say node fields that slug and here we're going to pass the actual component.

05:38.800 --> 05:47.560
Now the component is going to be the template that it uses in order to actually populate out the final

05:47.650 --> 05:48.970
blog post.

05:48.970 --> 05:52.570
So this is pretty much going to be a react component.

05:52.570 --> 05:58.220
And here we're going to make the new blog post template that we need to use for this context.

05:58.300 --> 06:03.130
So we do want to keep this component that we're going to build separate from our front end components

06:03.160 --> 06:06.800
because it will only be used inside of our Gatsby No j s file.

06:07.090 --> 06:12.730
So we'll make a new folder called templates and inside of here we're gonna make a new file called blog

06:12.730 --> 06:15.190
post doc J us.

06:15.220 --> 06:20.800
So normally you might be used to every react component that we write being dodgy ASX and this is totally

06:20.800 --> 06:27.250
valid too if you want to make it dodgy X but because every single react component that we have inside

06:27.310 --> 06:35.380
of our Gatsby folder is a dodgy s file for consistency sake we'll just use dot J.S. babble and knows

06:35.380 --> 06:40.270
that if you have react inside of your javascript it will convert it to regular javascript so it's not

06:40.270 --> 06:42.520
a big issue it'll still work.

06:42.520 --> 06:49.960
So here we're just going to say blog post dot J us now because this video is getting too long.

06:50.060 --> 06:54.290
Let's just break this up and continue this inside of our next lesson.
