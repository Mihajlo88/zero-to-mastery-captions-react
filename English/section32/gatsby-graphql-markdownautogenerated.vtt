00:00.480 --> 00:06.540
So with every Gatsby project because Gatsby rules with graph Q all by default as its query language

00:07.010 --> 00:13.170
you're able to actually access a graph q a playground by going to local host eight thousand underscore

00:13.260 --> 00:19.560
underscore underscore graph Q Well this will load up this playground that shows us all of the queries

00:19.560 --> 00:21.750
we're able to make inside of graph.

00:21.800 --> 00:28.490
Well now this is really good because we're actually able to do a lot of different things with this graph

00:28.510 --> 00:37.170
cool query list for example by default we're actually able to access every single file inside of our

00:37.170 --> 00:38.210
directory.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.970
Now when I say this what do I mean.

00:40.980 --> 00:46.950
So if you look inside of your Gatsby config you'll see that there's this plug in here called Gatsby

00:46.950 --> 00:48.340
source file system.

00:48.660 --> 00:55.680
Now Gatsby source file system is a way for you to actually access the nodes that represent the files

00:56.040 --> 01:03.150
inside of this directory with the name and the path the name just essentially allows us to tell Gatsby

01:03.240 --> 01:06.880
what it is that we want to put this under when we query for it.

01:07.380 --> 01:13.740
Now what are we creating for is actually going to be any files that lives inside this path that we provide

01:13.740 --> 01:14.390
it.

01:14.460 --> 01:19.530
So here we see that where string interpreting this directory name which pretty much just represents

01:19.530 --> 01:25.380
whatever the final directory structure is and I want to go into our source folder and then our images

01:25.380 --> 01:25.980
folder.

01:25.980 --> 01:31.820
So right here now it's named images because what it's trying to do is get all of the image files.

01:31.830 --> 01:38.370
Now if we go back to our graph you all will see that what it is that we got is actually this thing called

01:38.430 --> 01:44.700
all file now inside of this explorer you'll see this list of all the different queries that we can access.

01:44.730 --> 01:51.240
So if we wanted to actually see what that plugin was giving us if I do all file and I hit command enter

01:51.300 --> 01:56.940
or control enter if you're on a Windows you'll see that automatically populates with these properties

01:57.030 --> 02:04.560
of edges node and then the I.D. Now edges represent the actual path to that file that we're pointing

02:04.560 --> 02:05.280
to.

02:05.310 --> 02:12.650
So meaning that edges will be the array of the number of files that we have inside of our images folder.

02:12.750 --> 02:20.040
Now inside of every edge will be a node and that node is the representation of what that file is.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.640
Now the node Gatsby will convert for us.

02:22.770 --> 02:29.460
But what that means is that if we look inside of this list we'll be able to see what properties were

02:29.460 --> 02:31.800
actually able to pluck off and look at.

02:31.800 --> 02:39.690
So if we do absolute path and if we do relative path as well if we hit enter again we'll see that we're

02:39.690 --> 02:49.170
pointing to each of our image files and now by using this query we're actually able to get all of the

02:49.170 --> 02:52.430
files that we want inside of our project.

02:52.890 --> 02:59.730
So if we wanted to for example store different data inside of these files in order to actually represent

02:59.820 --> 03:05.490
our blogs we're able to do so using this all file query.

03:05.490 --> 03:10.410
Now we're definitely going to explore that because this is really how it is that we're going to build

03:10.470 --> 03:11.970
out our blocks.

03:11.970 --> 03:17.820
There is a couple of things that we have to make sure that we do first though one thing is that while

03:17.820 --> 03:25.230
we're able to see a representation of our files we cannot actually get the data in those files yet in

03:25.230 --> 03:31.530
order to do so we have to make some modifications to Gatsby and what we're going to write is going to

03:31.530 --> 03:36.350
be a little bit different than anything else you've probably ever written before.

03:36.360 --> 03:43.510
Now what we want to do is we want to start actually building our blocks there's a couple things that

03:43.510 --> 03:46.000
we have to do in order to set this up.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.600
The first is that we have to write the files that will hold the data of our blocks to begin with.

03:51.610 --> 03:55.450
So these could just be individual blog posts with some text on them.

03:55.600 --> 04:02.350
Now the way that we can actually build out the blog content and get access to all of the styling is

04:02.350 --> 04:04.540
to use something called Markdown.

04:04.540 --> 04:09.850
Now if you're unfamiliar with markdown markdown is what is used to build many of the read means that

04:09.850 --> 04:12.230
you see inside of GetUp.

04:12.460 --> 04:16.210
So you'll see that we have access to these different titles.

04:16.210 --> 04:23.110
We got access to the static linking we can put all of these images inside and we also get access to

04:23.110 --> 04:26.010
these code blocks inside of markdown.

04:26.440 --> 04:35.140
So markdown is a pretty consistently structured and very supported style of writing text that Gatsby

04:35.140 --> 04:36.930
also allows us to use.

04:36.940 --> 04:42.100
So if we wanted to write our blogs and get styling you really just need to learn a little bit of markdown.

04:42.190 --> 04:46.690
And I will give you a markdown cheat sheet that tells you all of the different styles you can apply

04:46.690 --> 04:49.250
in markdown when you start writing your blogs.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.030
But I have some pre written.

04:51.040 --> 04:57.730
So what we're going to do is we are going to make a new folder that is going to hold all of our markdown

04:57.730 --> 05:01.150
files that represent the blogs we're about to make.

05:01.150 --> 05:06.520
So go back to your application and what you're going to do is make a new file inside of your source

05:06.710 --> 05:14.220
or sorry a new folder and we're gonna call it markdown pages inside of markdown pages is going to be

05:14.310 --> 05:18.060
each markdown file that represents each blog post you're gonna write.

05:18.690 --> 05:24.240
So I'm going to make a new one and I'm going to call it ice cream and I'm gonna kind of ice cream dot

05:24.330 --> 05:33.550
M.D. now dot M.D. stands for markdown now inside of this I'm just going to paste my markdown code that

05:33.550 --> 05:39.460
represents the first blog that I'm writing and I am also going to give you this resource as well just

05:39.460 --> 05:44.300
so that you can walk through with me before you actually make your own markdown files.

05:44.320 --> 05:49.870
Now you'll notice at the top here there are these three dashes these three dashes represent what's called

05:49.870 --> 05:56.860
the front matter and the front matter is just kind of like some data that you can pull off of this markdown

05:56.860 --> 06:04.510
file and have it represent perhaps some data that you want to display inside of a snippet rather than

06:04.510 --> 06:08.200
the entire contents of the actual blog itself.

06:08.200 --> 06:13.600
This can also hold any metadata so you can just see the front matter as metadata and we're going to

06:13.600 --> 06:17.800
explore how to actually use it inside of our graph who all queries.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.420
So other than this one I actually also have a nother markdown file that I want to make and I want to

06:22.420 --> 06:25.440
call it my first AMH M.D..

06:25.630 --> 06:33.100
And similarly I have the other file here for you and here you'll see that I'm embedding an i frame.

06:33.100 --> 06:39.340
Now this I frame points to a YouTube link of the first AMA that I did a couple weeks ago.

06:39.340 --> 06:45.940
But this thing is actually going to be what you get from YouTube as an embed link so you can put this

06:45.940 --> 06:51.280
inside of markdown as well because markdown ends up being compelled to HDMI out and that's another great

06:51.280 --> 06:58.830
thing about using markdown is that using these two markdown files we're now able to represent our blogs

06:58.830 --> 07:04.620
very dynamically because if we wanted to write new blogs we simply just add new markdown files that

07:04.620 --> 07:05.820
represent our blogs.

07:05.820 --> 07:10.920
And then after we write the remaining code that will dynamically build out our blog posts we'll be pretty

07:10.920 --> 07:14.480
set in terms of our blog Web site.

07:14.490 --> 07:20.370
Now the one thing that we do have to do is we have to make sure that we're actually able to access these

07:20.370 --> 07:26.010
markdown files because as you remember inside of our config right now all we're doing with this file

07:26.010 --> 07:30.960
system is simply accessing images if we wanted access to markdown.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.010
We can just duplicate this block of code here.

07:34.020 --> 07:40.500
So copy paste it down except I'm going to change this name over to markdowns and instead of the path

07:40.500 --> 07:46.670
pointed to images I'm going to point to our new markdown pages path so let's save this.

07:46.670 --> 07:52.280
And what you have to do is you actually have to restart your server whenever you change any plugins

07:52.340 --> 07:53.850
inside of your config.

07:53.870 --> 07:59.510
So while we get hot reloading with a lot of the metadata or into the files that we change inside of

07:59.510 --> 08:03.550
our general structure we do not get it with our config plugins.

08:03.590 --> 08:08.930
If you change the plugin just restart your server and once it's finished building we're gonna go back

08:08.930 --> 08:14.650
to our graph queue all and we're going to take a look at what it is that we get so if we refresh now

08:15.000 --> 08:21.970
and we enter we still see our original image files but now we see that we also have our markdown files.

08:21.970 --> 08:27.700
So now that we're able to access the node representation of these markdown files let's actually figure

08:27.700 --> 08:33.340
out how to pull the data out of them in order to dynamically build out the pages that we need inside

08:33.340 --> 08:35.990
of our application to represent these blog posts.

08:36.130 --> 08:37.940
And that's all we're gonna do in the next lesson.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.060
So I'll see you in that lesson.
