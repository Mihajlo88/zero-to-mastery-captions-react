Hello.

00:02.250 --> 00:04.560
I'm very excited to start this course.

00:04.560 --> 00:10.720
But before we start everything we need to figure out where we're starting and where we're ending up.

00:10.770 --> 00:13.920
We want to have a clear path of success.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.000
This course is going to start off with some react basics.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.790
This is especially useful for those who have never written a single line of react or for those that

00:23.880 --> 00:25.580
need a bit of a refresher.

00:25.890 --> 00:29.810
In this section we're going to learn about why react exists.

00:29.820 --> 00:34.300
We're going to learn about the fundamental principles so that you can tell people.

00:34.410 --> 00:37.290
This is why react has become popular.

00:37.320 --> 00:38.790
These are the benefits.

00:38.820 --> 00:44.370
These are the pros and cons and we're also going to build a fun little project to get us comfortable

00:44.370 --> 00:45.480
with react.

00:45.480 --> 00:50.440
It's a big section but it's gonna be a lot of fun by the end of this section.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.960
You're going to know react basics.

00:53.040 --> 00:58.680
I mean that's what the section is called but this is the fun part using the basics that we've learned

00:58.680 --> 01:03.730
in this section we're going to right away start building our large e-commerce.

01:03.930 --> 01:10.560
We're going to introduce topics like react router and firebase to have different pages on our app and

01:10.560 --> 01:12.890
also do user assignments.

01:12.900 --> 01:19.020
We're also going to start adding redux into our application so that it's ready to scale.

01:19.020 --> 01:25.980
And then finally we're also going to add payments using the stripe API so that people can actually buy

01:25.980 --> 01:27.930
stuff from our store.

01:27.930 --> 01:35.280
And in this half of the course we're going to have a fully fledged e-commerce app where we store user

01:35.280 --> 01:42.660
information we use redux to store state react router to move between pages and stripe to actually make

01:42.810 --> 01:44.100
online purchases.

01:44.100 --> 01:47.490
And don't worry we're going to teach you these topics from scratch.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.660
And this is where most courses would stop.

01:50.730 --> 01:56.860
We'd have a nice app you'd learn the react basics and you'd feel comfortable working on a react project.

01:57.060 --> 02:03.540
But we take this a little bit further after we've gotten the fundamentals and we've built the main components

02:03.720 --> 02:05.370
of our application.

02:05.370 --> 02:12.690
We introduce you to advanced topics like CSX and J.S. we're going to convert our app to use a popular

02:12.780 --> 02:21.900
library called stout components and then we introduce redux saga a scalable way for us to handle asynchronous

02:21.900 --> 02:23.400
actions in our app.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.170
Then things get even more interesting.

02:26.340 --> 02:32.160
We actually start implementing hooks into our app and see how it compares with redux.

02:32.160 --> 02:38.040
We also use context API again comparing it how it's going to work with redux and hugs.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.450
And finally even add Graf.

02:40.450 --> 02:48.920
Q Well to manage at an even larger scale our state and by this point we have done a lot in our application.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.120
But we take it a little bit further.

02:51.180 --> 02:57.990
We start implementing firebase features in different ways even creating a stripe backend that you can

02:57.990 --> 03:02.460
use so that our app can actually process payments.

03:02.460 --> 03:09.030
We even talk about complex topics like design patterns including observable or higher components back

03:09.810 --> 03:15.360
and even touch on an important topic of performance how we can scale our applications and make them

03:15.360 --> 03:16.200
perform it.

03:16.260 --> 03:22.590
And finally the last two bonus sections where we actually learn about progressive web apps and implement

03:22.860 --> 03:29.730
our app as a progressive web app and then a nice section on testing where we use the just library to

03:29.730 --> 03:37.110
practice writing tests as you can see there's a lot in here and this won't be easy but we do promise

03:37.110 --> 03:40.380
you that we're going to make it fun along the way.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.040
And by the end of this course this all is going to make sense.

03:44.100 --> 03:48.660
These are going to be the skills that you will acquire throughout the course and by the end of it all

03:48.960 --> 03:55.560
you'd have had an app that implements all of these so that you can compare and contrast know when to

03:55.560 --> 03:59.980
use redux when to use context API when to use hooks or graph.

03:59.980 --> 04:04.900
Q Well you're going to be able to make smart decisions with any react project.

04:05.010 --> 04:11.070
We're going to take you from zero to mastery and along the way we might throw in a little joke or two

04:11.160 --> 04:16.980
to make it fun whether you're new to react or you've taken a few react courses by you still don't feel

04:16.980 --> 04:18.600
confident in your skills.

04:18.600 --> 04:25.920
This course is for everybody but the best part is this right here our online community we have over

04:25.920 --> 04:32.740
40000 developers chatting every day in our little community here where we help each other out.

04:32.760 --> 04:39.510
We work through problems together and we discuss the latest and greatest in the world of programming.

04:39.720 --> 04:45.330
And this is an optional resource for you to use so that you can have back and forth conversations with

04:45.360 --> 04:51.510
other students as well as myself an equal but you know what I can see you getting antsy and ready to

04:51.510 --> 04:55.610
start learning So enough talk let's learn let's get started.

04:55.770 --> 04:56.570
I'll see you in the next one.
