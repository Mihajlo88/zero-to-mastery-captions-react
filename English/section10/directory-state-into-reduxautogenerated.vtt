00:00.920 --> 00:01.790
Welcome back guys.

00:02.830 --> 00:08.050
Now I'm very proud of everyone for getting this far.

00:08.050 --> 00:15.590
What you've written up till now is a lot of the fundamental react and Redux code.

00:15.810 --> 00:20.670
Much of the patterns that you're writing are pretty much the patterns.

00:20.670 --> 00:26.760
90 percent of what you will write when building an application there is 10 percent where things get

00:26.760 --> 00:33.420
more advanced and more complicated when it comes to perhaps building more complex features.

00:33.420 --> 00:40.560
But the approach of breaking it one at a time and then fitting it inside of the existing flow of how

00:40.560 --> 00:48.120
we've been writing our react and Redux code is going to be definitely the sticking point of why your

00:48.120 --> 00:54.180
career as a javascript developer especially with react will all pay off in the end.

00:55.230 --> 01:03.090
Now up until this point we've been building new features with our react and Redux flow.

01:03.090 --> 01:09.600
But there's a couple things that we can actually move over and I want to do right now because we want

01:09.600 --> 01:16.500
to practice this pattern that we've been writing when building all the things that we've built in the

01:16.500 --> 01:20.730
last few lessons in order for us to figure out what they are.

01:21.030 --> 01:27.770
Let's take a look back at our application so there's a couple places right now where we're storing on

01:27.770 --> 01:35.700
a component state the things that we can actually move into our redux in our home page.

01:35.720 --> 01:44.280
We have our directory if you remember on our home page component on our home page component inside of

01:44.280 --> 01:51.220
our directory we keep the sections that we display inside of the state.

01:51.950 --> 01:58.580
But this is actually something that perhaps we can move in to our store because there's a opportunity

01:59.000 --> 02:04.370
for us to possibly move these sections into more than one component.

02:04.370 --> 02:11.950
For example if right now what we're displaying does not maybe work in a mobile view right.

02:11.960 --> 02:18.710
If our application shrinks and we want to display our directory in a way that's more mobile friendly

02:19.220 --> 02:25.280
we can pretty much just pull in the same array and then create a component that displays it in a mobile

02:25.280 --> 02:31.580
friendly way another place where we can modify is actually our shop.

02:31.750 --> 02:41.410
Right now we're keeping all of the collection data inside of our shop state and we do store it inside

02:41.410 --> 02:43.240
of the shop data.

02:43.240 --> 02:43.560
Right.

02:43.570 --> 02:54.250
DOJ us but it is being technically held on the shop component inside of the state and we can move this

02:54.250 --> 03:01.960
out as well because eventually we do want that same data to populate our category pages when we build

03:01.960 --> 03:03.140
that.

03:03.160 --> 03:12.090
So for example inside of our collections preview right now we show the first four items in each category

03:12.600 --> 03:17.160
but in the actual category page itself we want to show all the items.

03:17.160 --> 03:24.030
So we want to be able to share that data inside of our redux state so everything will have access to

03:24.030 --> 03:31.880
it so let's start doing that and get a better practice of our ReACT read stuff.

03:31.960 --> 03:38.530
The first thing I want to move out is actually what's in our directory component and for us to do this.

03:38.840 --> 03:47.140
We can make a directory redux folder so let's close some of this stuff and inside of our redux we will

03:47.140 --> 03:51.470
make a new folder called directory.

03:51.480 --> 03:58.840
Now we don't have anything that actually updates these sections so we don't actually need any actions.

03:58.950 --> 04:03.920
We just want a place to store are directory literally at State.

04:04.710 --> 04:16.050
So we'll just make a reducer so we'll do directory reducer dot J.S. and for our reducer we are just

04:16.050 --> 04:23.980
going to set our initial state first and our national state will point to this directory information

04:27.220 --> 04:31.070
and it will pretty much be the default state.

04:31.080 --> 04:39.330
Now you might be wondering is there really a reason for us to move this outside of our directory class

04:39.330 --> 04:46.940
component if we're not going to update it or if we don't currently have another component that's going

04:46.940 --> 04:54.620
to pull it in Well this is actually where there's a lot of debate about whether or not it's worth it

04:54.620 --> 05:02.400
to keep one time use on modifiable data inside of a component.

05:02.420 --> 05:09.590
Some people say that it's a little bit of overkill to move this data where it's only being used in one

05:09.590 --> 05:17.390
place and not being updated into redux but there's actually a benefit to doing this that we will not

05:17.390 --> 05:23.190
explore until later on the course inside of our testing section.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.530
But one thing that we've largely not talked about is testing.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.960
And the reason why is because testing it's extremely important inside of web development.

05:32.720 --> 05:40.040
But it's really important to grasp the fundamentals before we start writing our tests because testing

05:40.700 --> 05:47.000
and learning about testing really makes sense once you grasp the fundamentals of what it is that you're

05:47.000 --> 05:54.860
writing because in a way testing is its own thing that builds upon the fundamental understanding that

05:54.860 --> 05:56.420
you already have.

05:56.420 --> 06:06.320
But to the original point moving our state outside of our component and into their own reduced hours

06:06.410 --> 06:12.860
actually makes it easier to test but we won't talk about that for now.

06:12.950 --> 06:15.810
I just want you to perhaps think about what's to come.

06:16.010 --> 06:22.190
But it also sets us up in a way so that in the future if we do need to use these sections again we already

06:22.190 --> 06:23.800
have the code set up for us.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.790
There's no harm in doing it.

06:26.330 --> 06:31.580
And it allows our directory component in some ways to be more reusable.

06:31.770 --> 06:40.960
So now that we have our directory reducer let's actually build a reduce code so I'll say concept directory

06:41.020 --> 06:44.530
reducer equals this

06:47.590 --> 06:57.940
that takes a state if we remember right which by default will be the initial state and then we're also

06:57.940 --> 07:00.700
going to have our action

07:03.640 --> 07:11.020
and what we'll say is a switch statement on action type but inside we'll just write our default which

07:11.020 --> 07:14.040
is to return state.

07:14.110 --> 07:18.870
This is perfectly fine if we have more actions that might modify the state.

07:18.970 --> 07:25.240
We'll bring them in after but for now this is good enough and we'll export out our directory reducer

07:26.470 --> 07:29.830
now inside of our root reducer.

07:29.880 --> 07:33.120
We gotta remember to bring in our new reducer.

07:33.120 --> 07:45.140
Our directory reducer from directory directory reducer and then let's point to the directory reducer

07:45.350 --> 07:56.370
under the directory key and now inside of our directory component we can just simply pull that component

07:57.050 --> 08:04.260
or sorry pull the connect and write our hired or connect component from react redux

08:07.760 --> 08:11.150
and here we will actually write our connect.

08:11.870 --> 08:21.860
So because we don't need this local state anymore we can just render a regular Functional Component

08:22.970 --> 08:25.850
because we don't need

08:28.750 --> 08:29.560
access to state.

08:29.590 --> 08:36.230
So there's no reason to use a class component so let's get rid of extra brackets here

08:39.720 --> 08:42.150
and then we'll make sure to pull the sections

08:47.810 --> 08:58.480
our props that we get in and then we'll write our map state to props where we can write our directory

08:58.480 --> 08:58.960
selector

09:04.090 --> 09:06.470
so we'll make a new directory.

09:06.480 --> 09:19.210
Dot selectors dot J.S. and here we're going to import create selector from re select we're gonna make

09:19.210 --> 09:28.930
our first selector which is our directory selector select directory equals a function that gets the

09:28.930 --> 09:41.210
state and just returns us state DOT directory and then we'll actually write our first selector which

09:41.210 --> 09:53.570
will be select directory section shall be equal to create selector taking in our select directory and

09:53.570 --> 09:55.130
then outputting directory

09:58.110 --> 10:07.340
directory dot section freight selector so let's bring that into our directory component

10:10.200 --> 10:15.010
it will be from our redux folder

10:18.170 --> 10:20.610
directory slash directory.

10:20.630 --> 10:21.320
Selectors

10:23.970 --> 10:29.550
and we want our select directory sections as well as our create structured selector

10:32.370 --> 10:40.080
reseller so it's definitely a lot of files and a lot of moving around and jumping between these files

10:40.260 --> 10:43.970
importing the right libraries and remembering all these things.

10:44.160 --> 10:49.290
It took me a long time to get fully comfortable with being able to just remember all the moving parts

10:49.290 --> 11:00.680
as well but again practice makes perfect so we will call create structured selector passing our sections

11:01.290 --> 11:06.360
or select directories section and then we will connect

11:10.300 --> 11:23.810
PA directory with our map stage props and now double imported okay.

11:23.880 --> 11:32.260
And now if we look we see that in our final application on our home page our code still works.

11:32.400 --> 11:41.170
We have our directory and we have our sections inside of our state so it's definitely a lot of files

11:41.170 --> 11:41.790
to remember.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.680
And even then we're not writing any actions.

11:43.690 --> 11:49.840
But even this is still good practice just to remember all of the parts of flowing through writing a

11:49.840 --> 11:57.330
new reducer attaching it to our state pulling it into our components practice makes perfect.

11:57.510 --> 12:01.210
The more practice we have the better it gets.

12:01.210 --> 12:06.850
So now let's do this for our shop before we build our category pages because we'll definitely need our

12:06.850 --> 12:08.740
shop in its own reducer.
