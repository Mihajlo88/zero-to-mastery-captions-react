00:01.350 --> 00:08.730
So we learned that react had this revolutionary idea of let me handle the damn updates because I know

00:08.730 --> 00:11.150
the best way to do them the most efficient way.

00:11.190 --> 00:12.220
You don't have to do that.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.990
Just tell me what the page should look like.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.540
Next big game changer was this idea of building Web sites like Lego blocks reactors designed around

00:24.540 --> 00:34.220
the concept of reusable components just like you see in this app how each square or rectangle has different

00:34.220 --> 00:35.420
color.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.650
Well these are all components.

00:37.790 --> 00:43.220
Each of these individual pieces create this whole app react.

00:43.220 --> 00:49.490
Had this idea of small components that you put them together to form bigger components.

00:49.490 --> 00:51.880
So you had the profile picture component.

00:51.980 --> 01:00.460
You had the add component and then you had the navigation bar component and within here you had components

01:00.550 --> 01:01.750
containing components.

01:01.900 --> 01:07.940
So you had a component in here that was surrounded by another component that was surrounded by an ever

01:08.170 --> 01:16.900
bigger component just like Lego blocks and all these small components whether they're large or big can

01:16.900 --> 01:18.850
be used in different places.

01:18.850 --> 01:24.580
For example I can have this component just copied over to multiple locations because while they're the

01:24.580 --> 01:34.030
same thing and I can even move these over to different projects and reuse them so people can build these

01:34.030 --> 01:42.580
components like material UI components that I could just copy and paste this code and added to my projects

01:43.180 --> 01:51.770
like so you had different component libraries like react bootstrap again or something like blueprint

01:53.010 --> 01:59.580
so people can now share these components across different Web sites across different projects and they

01:59.580 --> 02:01.940
will all work.

02:02.010 --> 02:12.200
Now this idea of components and react in a simple term is just plain JavaScript functions that we write

02:13.870 --> 02:19.610
so we have the state over app or that is any data that describes our app.

02:19.690 --> 02:27.640
For example the user is logged in whether it's true or false and maybe friends then components are created

02:27.640 --> 02:32.490
based on that data well simply as functions.

02:32.690 --> 02:33.560
And don't worry.

02:33.590 --> 02:34.940
Don't get intimidated by this.

02:34.940 --> 02:37.820
This is something that we'll cover throughout the course.

02:37.820 --> 02:46.730
But components are simply just JavaScript functions that received some sort of input or attributes which

02:46.730 --> 02:48.320
we call props.

02:48.320 --> 02:56.160
And in return it returns this thing that kind of looks like HDMI all but inside of JavaScript and these

02:56.160 --> 03:00.540
components can be built like this as a function or even as a class.

03:00.660 --> 03:08.550
But the key here is that based on the state and these components that we built we have an entire component

03:08.550 --> 03:14.500
that we can add to our page and reuse maybe over here as well if we wanted to.

03:14.790 --> 03:18.130
Just like Lego blocks now.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.600
Here is a simple react to do application.

03:22.090 --> 03:27.130
And I'm going to be using something called the react developer tools which I recommend you install as

03:27.130 --> 03:29.220
well in the Chrome Web Store.

03:29.320 --> 03:35.980
You can add it to Google as an extension and what it allows you is when you click view developer developer

03:35.980 --> 03:46.170
tools you'll now have the element stamp which shows you the dom of your app which you can see over here

03:47.440 --> 03:59.060
but also a new tab called react and this react plugin actually allows you to see the components that

03:59.060 --> 04:02.210
we built into an application.

04:02.230 --> 04:11.750
Now you can see over here that this isn't exactly HCM l we're creating custom tags like header or filtered

04:11.750 --> 04:16.790
list or footer that isn't valid HDMI all but you'll see that inside here.

04:16.910 --> 04:27.280
All of these are actually well built by a shim on elements like header H1 or input.

04:27.290 --> 04:34.910
So again this idea of a components architecture means that we can have some sort of data about our application

04:35.600 --> 04:42.440
and we build these components ourselves and these components are what we call react components that

04:42.440 --> 04:52.760
we built out of a metal tags that signify a component and each of these components work together to

04:52.760 --> 05:01.030
eventually have our app and this component architecture is really really key in react because it allows

05:01.030 --> 05:08.530
us to reuse and share components between projects so that if you wanted a date picker on your app well

05:08.590 --> 05:14.320
instead of maybe building it yourself you can just google for it and say react date picker component

05:14.680 --> 05:20.890
and just use somebody else's code but there's two more key concepts to get through.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.570
So let's do that in the next video.
