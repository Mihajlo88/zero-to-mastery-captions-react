Hello and welcome to the best react course online.

00:05.070 --> 00:10.830
Wow that's a that's a bit of a bold statement and OK I may be biased here but I'm definitely looking

00:10.830 --> 00:17.850
forward to us diving into some fun topics and coming out the other end as great react developers this

00:17.850 --> 00:23.750
course tries to build onto each topic and gets more and more advanced as you progressed.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.240
Trust me if you go through everything you will come out the other end.

00:27.240 --> 00:34.310
Confident with react and be able to manage or even lead react projects your company now.

00:34.320 --> 00:40.440
Before we dive into coding building projects and learning about react I want to take a moment and understand

00:40.500 --> 00:42.710
why react exists.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.810
What problem does it solve.

00:44.820 --> 00:51.600
Why it makes front end development easier and also what principles we need to understand to be more

00:51.600 --> 00:54.090
than the average react developer.

00:54.360 --> 01:00.810
You see a lot of times people learn a tool a library or a framework without understanding the core principles

01:00.840 --> 01:04.770
that make it great by learning these things first.

01:04.860 --> 01:11.010
We'll have a foundation as we move through the course and understand what the best practices are.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.840
The goal of this course is not to be another react course like thousands of others already out there

01:15.840 --> 01:17.040
in existence.

01:17.070 --> 01:20.770
The goal is to make you a reactive helper that can think on your own.

01:20.880 --> 01:27.570
Make good architectural decisions and lead projects instead of only following tutorials.

01:27.570 --> 01:32.820
Therefore in this section let's dive into the important principles that will help us get through this

01:32.820 --> 01:33.670
course.

01:33.750 --> 01:38.730
If you are new to react some of these principles may be hard to understand at first.

01:38.730 --> 01:44.400
Rest assured that we will keep revisiting them throughout the course as we learn for those that have

01:44.430 --> 01:46.070
already worked with react.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.800
You may learn a thing or two so hang in there.

01:48.810 --> 01:53.700
My goal by the end of this section is for you to be able to explain to other programmers the benefit

01:53.700 --> 02:00.350
of react without writing a single line of code I do recommend that this section is something you come

02:00.350 --> 02:03.830
back to after you've watched through the entire course.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.670
All right enough talk let's get started.
