00:00.360 --> 00:09.480
So let's open our sign in and sign up component let's import our new sign up component into this component

00:10.080 --> 00:11.640
components.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.420
Sign up.

00:12.600 --> 00:17.910
Sign up component and then let's just place it underneath our sign.

00:19.870 --> 00:26.250
Now in order for our component to sit side by side we need to apply some styles so let's go to our style

00:26.250 --> 00:26.610
sheet.

00:27.780 --> 00:30.790
And let's do sign in and sign up.

00:30.830 --> 00:38.910
CLASS WITH THE STYLE WHERE THE WIDTH IS EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY pixels and then we want to display a

00:38.910 --> 00:45.000
flex and we want to justify content space between

00:47.760 --> 00:55.560
and then we want to also make it so that our margin on the left and the right is automatic.

00:55.560 --> 01:02.160
So we'll do a margin top and bottom of let's say 30 pixels for now.

01:03.710 --> 01:05.370
And then auto.

01:05.450 --> 01:13.860
Now if we save we go back to our component we see that we have our sign in and sign up now.

01:13.890 --> 01:23.790
Now let's actually see if we're actually saving this user profile the way that we expect it to.

01:23.850 --> 01:29.670
Let's go to our app G.S. and let's just console dot log the state whenever it changes

01:35.660 --> 01:40.890
and now let's open up our terminal so we currently have a user.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.270
Right.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.340
We have our current user which is set to this well and then we have a user being set.

01:46.380 --> 01:47.520
We might have accidentally did this.

01:47.550 --> 01:54.340
Oh we've got to change this current user it's a little mistake we made earlier.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.060
OK.

01:56.260 --> 01:59.200
So now our current user is set because we are signed in.

01:59.230 --> 02:00.880
So let's sign up.

02:01.060 --> 02:10.160
Let's refresh and now let's create our new account so I'm going to use let's say just a random account.

02:10.180 --> 02:14.610
It doesn't actually matter what's wrong value display name.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.670
I'm going to call me Mike.

02:16.670 --> 02:23.150
I'm going to use Michael gmail dot com password will be one two three four one two three four.

02:23.350 --> 02:24.610
And then one two three four.

02:24.610 --> 02:26.050
Now let's see if we try it right.

02:26.080 --> 02:31.470
If we have the wrong password we'll get the alert that says passwords don't match which is what we want.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.670
So one two three four four correct password.

02:33.700 --> 02:39.860
And now if we hit sign up get a 400 off operation not allowed.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.690
We did not enable email and password in our authentication.

02:44.810 --> 02:52.190
So just as we did earlier with the Google sign in we've got to do the same thing with our e-mail and

02:52.190 --> 02:53.120
password.

02:53.120 --> 03:01.640
So here we just have to enable it and we just hit save email link password list will actually send an

03:01.700 --> 03:05.230
email to that email that they provide.

03:05.300 --> 03:08.960
And then if you click confirm it will automatically authenticate them.

03:08.990 --> 03:10.810
But we don't want that.

03:10.850 --> 03:13.000
So let's try and

03:16.060 --> 03:19.160
and there we go it fired a couple of times.

03:19.200 --> 03:19.760
Right.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.660
But there is our current user object created app.

03:23.730 --> 03:27.160
They use a different timestamp than are created a data object right.

03:27.180 --> 03:31.890
But there we go display name email and then the I.D..

03:31.890 --> 03:34.430
And now if we look inside of our database.

03:34.440 --> 03:34.730
Right.

03:34.740 --> 03:40.290
If we look in our off let's all look at our database in our off we see that we have this Michael user

03:40.680 --> 03:43.560
where the provider they signed in with was the email.

03:43.860 --> 03:51.450
But if we check our database we'll see that we now have a third user which is the one that we just made

03:52.200 --> 04:02.420
right here let's just delete this user that we wrote manually and we can do this by hitting right here

04:03.530 --> 04:13.940
delay document this is for the user that we manually created and now we have two users one created by

04:14.030 --> 04:17.590
our email and password and one created by Google.

04:17.690 --> 04:24.640
Now let's commit our code before we finally implement sign in with email and password.

04:24.910 --> 04:27.890
Now let's check its status.

04:28.730 --> 04:29.120
OK.

04:29.140 --> 04:38.220
Let's get add all our stuff and we'll write a comment message that says implemented firebase utilize

04:39.090 --> 04:51.260
included ability to store authenticated users into our fire store database that will push this up to

04:51.260 --> 04:55.610
master and continue with the next lesson.
