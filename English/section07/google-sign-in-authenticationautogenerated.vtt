00:00.690 --> 00:08.430
Now that we have our fire base utility library inside of our project let's actually set it up so that

00:08.430 --> 00:11.750
we can start using it in our application.

00:11.790 --> 00:19.830
Now what we want to do is go into our project directory and we are going to add a new folder in our

00:19.830 --> 00:25.290
source called firebase inside of this fire base.

00:25.290 --> 00:34.220
We are going to make a new file called firebase dot utilize dot J.S. now in order to properly use and

00:34.220 --> 00:39.950
set up our fire base utility files or utility methods.

00:39.950 --> 00:43.270
We actually need that config object.

00:43.520 --> 00:46.880
So if you accidentally lost it somehow.

00:46.910 --> 00:54.780
I'll show you how you can navigate back to finding that configuration we want to go from our dashboard

00:54.810 --> 01:01.350
to project overview which is this page and then you'll see this grid item here.

01:01.350 --> 01:05.680
If you click this you'll see our application or sorry.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.610
You'll see our fire project.

01:08.610 --> 01:13.830
So we want to click this and then scroll down.

01:13.830 --> 01:17.900
You should see this SDK snippet with the CBN.

01:18.300 --> 01:21.820
That object that we want is right here.

01:21.900 --> 01:29.250
So we just want to copy this go back to our firebase utilize and then we're going to import firebase

01:29.340 --> 01:39.420
from firebase slash app so by doing this we're pulling in the firebase utility library that belongs

01:39.480 --> 01:42.120
at this firebase slash app.

01:42.120 --> 01:48.090
Now the reason we do firebase slash app is because firebase has all of the utility libraries loaded

01:48.090 --> 01:54.570
when we included the entire dependency when we installed firebase with ya.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.030
But we don't want any that we're not using because they are quite large.

02:00.270 --> 02:01.940
So whenever we need them.

02:01.950 --> 02:06.920
So in this case we need off and storage.

02:07.380 --> 02:17.550
We can import them themselves by exporting firebase slash fire store for the database and firebase slash

02:17.700 --> 02:26.040
off for the off we always need the base import though because that keyword is going to give us access

02:26.040 --> 02:33.490
to fast or an author when we import them in they'll be just automatically attached to this firebase

02:33.540 --> 02:42.110
keyword and then what we're want to do is we want to set our content config equal to that object that

02:42.110 --> 02:51.560
we just stored and then we call firebase dot initialize app with that config.

02:51.730 --> 02:58.200
Now what I'm about to type next will be quite a bit of code.

02:58.330 --> 03:04.420
It will make sense once we start using it but because it's config it might seem a little confusing because

03:04.420 --> 03:11.440
we are mainly configuring the firebase utility that we get all of it is in the documentation on firebase

03:11.500 --> 03:16.650
itself but these are the ones that we need for Google authentication.

03:16.780 --> 03:25.480
So what we want to do is we want to export const off which is equal to Firebase dot off.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.770
So when I mentioned that we imported firebase off that is what we manage to get access to is the dart

03:30.790 --> 03:36.790
off method on Firebase and we want to export this out anywhere that we we need to use anything related

03:36.790 --> 03:38.800
to authentication.

03:38.900 --> 03:47.300
Next we are also going to export the store that we imported the same way that we did with the off so

03:47.300 --> 03:55.380
we don't need this yet but it's better for us to just export this for now now to set up our Google authentication

03:55.380 --> 03:56.090
utility.

03:56.100 --> 04:02.380
So this part is a little bit complicated but just follow along.

04:02.610 --> 04:12.870
We're gonna do a cost provider equals new firebase off Google off provider and this gives us access

04:12.870 --> 04:18.250
to this new Google auth provider class from the authentication library.

04:18.420 --> 04:29.810
It takes a couple custom parameters using the custom parameters method and what we want to set is prompt

04:30.320 --> 04:32.900
select account.

04:32.900 --> 04:40.670
What this means is that we want to always trigger the Google pop up when ever we use this Google auth

04:40.670 --> 04:47.150
provider for authentication and sign in and I'll show you what I mean when we use it.

04:47.180 --> 04:57.190
So we're also going to export out sign in this sign in with Google method that is equal to a function

04:57.940 --> 05:06.460
that calls off dot sign in with pop up because sign and with pop up takes this provider class that we

05:06.460 --> 05:11.260
made but it takes it for many different types of pop ups right.

05:11.260 --> 05:14.120
We just want the Google want but there's a Twitter one right.

05:14.350 --> 05:20.530
There's all kinds available to us in our sign in but we just set we want to set sign on with pop up

05:20.650 --> 05:28.780
and then we want to pass this provider through now we also want to finally export default will be firebase

05:28.790 --> 05:31.010
in case we want the whole library.

05:31.010 --> 05:34.180
But you know how I mentioned that there's multiple pop ups.

05:34.190 --> 05:40.340
Well let's actually configure our firebase project to allow us to use Google sign it and I'll show you

05:40.340 --> 05:41.830
how easy that is.

05:41.870 --> 05:48.800
So all we do is we go back to our firebase project and we click this authentication under the developer

05:49.040 --> 05:56.810
tag here we're gonna click set up sign and method and under this Google option we just hit the edit

05:57.320 --> 06:04.700
pencil enable it we'll select the email that we want.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.800
Projects support to have.

06:06.810 --> 06:07.080
Right.

06:07.110 --> 06:12.930
So in case anything goes wrong with firebase at all for anything related to support they're going to

06:12.930 --> 06:15.020
send it to this email that you have here.

06:15.030 --> 06:21.490
And usually it's the email from your Google account that you use to sign into firebase.

06:21.600 --> 06:30.420
We just hit save and now it's enabled we have 0 off enabled for our project using Google and now we're

06:30.420 --> 06:35.340
going to use this signing with Google inside of our sign and component.

06:35.340 --> 06:45.710
So we're going to import it in sign with Google from firebase firebase use hills.

06:46.110 --> 06:47.140
Get rid of that dog.

06:47.180 --> 06:47.930
Yes.

06:48.390 --> 06:49.900
And to see how easy it is.

06:49.980 --> 07:00.280
We just are going to copy our button remove type submit and fire a on click that calls our sign and

07:00.280 --> 07:01.570
with Google method.

07:01.780 --> 07:10.720
And now if we do sign in with Google whenever we click it our button in our application so let's refresh

07:11.870 --> 07:19.520
we see our button we click it and there's the Google prompt it will load any Google accounts that we

07:19.520 --> 07:22.970
already have or the users already signed in with.

07:22.970 --> 07:28.000
And we select it and firebase will handle the authentication there.

07:28.790 --> 07:32.900
Just like that we have authentication with Google tied into our application.

07:33.140 --> 07:38.970
But how do we actually utilize these users that firebase is logging in with.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.270
Well let's do that right now.
