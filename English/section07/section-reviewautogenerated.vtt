In this section we learned all about creating forms as well as being able to create user sessions and

00:09.740 --> 00:15.820
AUTHENTICATING USERS with signing in with email and password as well as signing it with Google.

00:16.230 --> 00:21.420
And we also had our sign up page where we're able to create a new user.

00:21.490 --> 00:28.020
Now if you noticed there were two places that we had to remember or store user information.

00:28.180 --> 00:31.340
The first one was firebase right.

00:31.360 --> 00:37.660
We needed to remember a user so that when they come back one day maybe tomorrow or maybe a year from

00:37.660 --> 00:40.060
now we have their information.

00:40.060 --> 00:48.280
So a backend database like we use them firebase is a way for us to remember that information of the

00:48.280 --> 00:48.970
user.

00:48.970 --> 00:56.050
So initially we stored that information there but once we have it in the back end we now need to get

00:56.170 --> 01:03.740
access to it on the front end because on the front end we also have to remember that information.

01:03.760 --> 01:12.360
So when a user signs up and they click sign up well we're going to store that information in our firebase

01:13.560 --> 01:20.370
however when a user comes back and let's say signs and with Google or signs up with email and password

01:20.940 --> 01:26.420
we check our far base data and say Hey does this user exist.

01:26.520 --> 01:35.400
And if they do or if they sign in with Google I want you to store that State of the user in our app.

01:35.400 --> 01:43.590
Remember that information in our app so that as the user starts to move through our e-commerce Web site

01:44.130 --> 01:48.420
we have that information so that they can check out they can update their card.

01:48.540 --> 01:54.060
So by the end of this section I hope you understand the importance of remembering a user where something

01:54.120 --> 02:00.600
like a backend end and then requesting that information from the back end so that you can store it as

02:00.690 --> 02:10.300
state on the front end and be able to use it to allow the user to have a proper shopping experience.

02:10.340 --> 02:13.910
We have a long way to go so let's keep going and I'll see you in the next section.
