00:01.280 --> 00:08.190
In our app we've started to build our sign in component now up to this point.

00:08.230 --> 00:13.310
We don't really have the functionality because we need to store this somewhere.

00:13.420 --> 00:21.100
We need to store it in a database and it was going to go over that in the next video but this firebase

00:21.100 --> 00:25.740
section is very important because it mimics a real life scenario.

00:26.020 --> 00:32.680
You see most of the time when you're working with something like firebase you have to realize that developers

00:32.830 --> 00:40.760
like myself or EA Hwa aren't going to memorize the entire firebase library because this is always evolving.

00:40.780 --> 00:42.850
This is always changing.

00:42.880 --> 00:49.560
So for example if I Google Firebase and go to their docs their documentation over the next couple of

00:49.560 --> 00:56.070
videos we're going to see some of the implementation that he was going to show that is actually part

00:56.070 --> 00:57.120
of the documentation.

00:57.120 --> 01:00.150
So if we could can get started for the web

01:02.940 --> 01:08.980
this documentation is going to explain pretty well how we can implement what we're about to implement.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.980
For example if we go to authentication and we click over here web and in our case let's say Google sign

01:15.970 --> 01:24.770
in it's going to have some pretty nice documentation of how we can add this feature to our app and most

01:24.770 --> 01:30.620
likely when you're building something on your own like this or for a company you're going to go through

01:30.620 --> 01:36.140
these documentation you're not going to memorize what we're going to teach you in these videos in your

01:36.140 --> 01:37.820
head because it's impossible.

01:37.820 --> 01:39.560
There's so many tools out there.

01:39.590 --> 01:46.670
The key thing here to remember is that professional developers what they do is they understand that

01:46.670 --> 01:54.020
hey I'm going to use Firebase for let's say storage and authentication and they're able to go to the

01:54.020 --> 02:01.180
documentation rethinks and understand that hey when we install npm install firebase as a package.

02:01.430 --> 02:09.640
Well these are the documentations that I can use to setup Firebase and you'll see that in our code we're

02:09.640 --> 02:15.160
going to do some of the things that you'll see in the documentation such as this.

02:15.200 --> 02:22.730
So if over the next couple of videos things get overwhelming and you're thinking to yourself Wow ee

02:22.740 --> 02:24.140
Hwa is just amazing.

02:24.140 --> 02:27.800
Andre is just amazing they know firebase inside and out.

02:27.800 --> 02:33.050
Keep in mind that no developer memorizes a library like firebase.

02:33.050 --> 02:39.140
What we do is we study the documentation and then we implement it into our code.

02:39.140 --> 02:44.780
So yes we record these videos and it looks like everything is perfect but it involves us going back

02:44.810 --> 02:52.460
and forth with the documentation trying out things with step by step and this is something that often

02:52.460 --> 02:54.410
is uncovered and tutorials.

02:54.410 --> 02:58.280
When we work with libraries like this documentation is your friend

03:01.050 --> 03:02.160
before we get started.

03:02.170 --> 03:09.240
Remember if this next session seems overwhelming seems extra complicated you always have the documentation

03:09.240 --> 03:11.790
to go to to read to read up more.

03:11.930 --> 03:12.330
All right.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.980
Hopefully I don't scare you too much.

03:13.980 --> 03:14.770
Let's get started.
