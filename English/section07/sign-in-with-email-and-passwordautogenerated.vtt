00:00.510 --> 00:06.720
Now let's finish implementing the handle submit method in our sign up component.

00:06.850 --> 00:14.230
Now what we're going to do in handle submit will be very similar to what we just did in sign up in our

00:14.230 --> 00:15.370
sign up component.

00:15.370 --> 00:19.480
We called off dot create user with e-mail and password.

00:19.480 --> 00:27.100
Passing an email and password and sign in will have a very similar method on the off library that is

00:27.100 --> 00:29.890
called sign in with email and password.

00:30.100 --> 00:37.610
So let's import off from our firebase utilize and now inside of our handles submit we have to convert

00:37.610 --> 00:48.800
this to an async method and d structure off the email and password off our state and then in our tribe

00:48.800 --> 00:57.950
block we are going to await for off dot sign in with email and password passing in the email and the

00:57.950 --> 01:09.180
password and then if that succeeds we will clear our state and then we'll have our catch with our error

01:09.870 --> 01:15.540
where we will console dot log the error if it fails.

01:15.700 --> 01:24.750
Now let's see our component so we are still logging any state changes and we need to sign out first

01:25.930 --> 01:29.920
and let's try and now sign in with our account.

01:29.920 --> 01:38.320
So we had Michael at g mail dot com with our password being 1 2.

01:38.330 --> 01:44.180
Well what's going on with our password here Oh no.

01:44.460 --> 01:49.580
It looks like our sign up component has the wrong code or sorry our signing component.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.570
We might actually be passing in the wrong value here.

01:53.640 --> 01:54.390
Yes we are.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.500
OK.

01:55.650 --> 02:00.210
We have to fix this value so that it's state DOT password.

02:00.210 --> 02:02.090
Sometimes accidents happen.

02:02.100 --> 02:07.490
So now let's check again OK now it seems to be working normally.

02:08.030 --> 02:16.190
So let's reset these values because Michael at gmail dot com and password if we remember was one two

02:16.190 --> 02:18.930
three four one two three four.

02:18.960 --> 02:25.970
Now if we sign in we see that our user has been updated with our user.

02:25.980 --> 02:30.410
That was just signed up inside of our database.

02:30.660 --> 02:33.710
We can double check and make sure that this I.D. matches.

02:33.900 --> 02:39.330
So PATCO ATF J is p ATF J.

02:39.330 --> 02:40.050
Awesome.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.540
So we know that everything is syncs up and properly working.

02:44.820 --> 02:53.850
Now let's remove that console log here because we won't need it anymore and let's just commit this code

02:53.940 --> 03:07.910
because now we finished our sign in and sign up component so get add get commit finishing sign in handle

03:09.050 --> 03:18.660
submit method and then let's get push origin master OK let's continue.
