WEBVTT

00:00.640 --> 00:01.410
OK.

00:01.690 --> 00:09.130
Now the first thing we need to do to set a firebase is we have to go to the firebase Web site and create

00:09.190 --> 00:10.920
a fire base project.

00:11.140 --> 00:14.060
How we do that is on the Web site.

00:14.110 --> 00:18.040
If you're not signed into a Google account do that now.

00:18.040 --> 00:22.560
And when you do you will have access to this go to console button.

00:22.720 --> 00:29.420
So we click that and it will launch the firebase console now on this console.

00:29.420 --> 00:32.290
I have some projects already but you don't need this.

00:32.300 --> 00:38.650
So what you're going to do is you're going to click ad project and then you're going to name it whatever

00:38.650 --> 00:39.100
you want.

00:39.100 --> 00:48.720
So I'm gonna name mine Crown DV and we're gonna accept the terms and conditions and we're gonna hit

00:48.720 --> 00:52.410
create project.

00:52.580 --> 00:57.850
And while it's loading it's essentially setting up all of our authentication services.

00:57.890 --> 01:01.760
Our database our backend everything for us.

01:01.880 --> 01:06.830
So this is actually quite fast considering all of the things that it's doing for us.

01:06.830 --> 01:11.750
Once it's ready we hit continue and it will take us to this dashboard.

01:11.750 --> 01:15.410
Now in this dashboard there's two main things I want to focus on.

01:15.410 --> 01:20.610
The first is this bottom section where we see the plant.

01:20.750 --> 01:29.180
So for the free plan is honestly enough for all of our needs and purposes for not only testing but also

01:29.180 --> 01:33.560
when we deploy this live as our portfolio project.

01:33.560 --> 01:41.630
It's very rare that we will probably exceed any of the request amount limits on the free spark plant

01:42.590 --> 01:45.440
but if we do it's not that expensive.

01:45.440 --> 01:51.890
If you do with the pay as you go because you essentially only pay for anything you exceed by and it's

01:51.950 --> 01:58.700
generally going to be pretty marginal because it's not actually a full fledged app in production with

01:58.700 --> 02:05.000
a lot of users after we look at this we got to look at our developed section.

02:05.180 --> 02:08.830
So here we're going to see all of the services that are available to us.

02:08.840 --> 02:15.290
The main ones we want to focus on are the authentication and the database so the authentication has

02:15.290 --> 02:22.910
to do with what authentication varieties like sine and methods we want our fire base to have access

02:22.910 --> 02:23.590
to.

02:23.930 --> 02:28.040
We'll go into this a little deeper a little later once we start integrating it.

02:28.280 --> 02:36.410
The database is actually where it's going to hold all of the data that we want to store in our firebase

02:36.440 --> 02:37.530
project.

02:37.580 --> 02:40.600
And again we're also going to cover that a little later.

02:40.610 --> 02:45.950
Storage is for storing images videos and more like assets.

02:45.980 --> 02:53.660
If we wanted to host them somewhere on the web the hosting is if we wanted firebase to handle are Web

02:53.660 --> 02:58.940
sites hosting for us which we don't need that functions we don't have to worry about.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.590
And M.L. kit is from machine learning which we also do not need to worry about.

03:04.310 --> 03:12.070
So let's configure our firebase so what we gonna do is we had a go to this project overview tab and

03:12.070 --> 03:19.550
then we're gonna hit this little icon that says Web then we're going to register app with a nickname

03:19.790 --> 03:22.340
and this nickname is Morse for it mostly internal.

03:22.340 --> 03:28.960
So it's not really important but I'm just going to call it Crown DV and then I'm going to hit register

03:28.970 --> 03:30.240
app.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.870
We don't need to setup firebase hosting because we don't need that but it's an optional thing and then

03:35.870 --> 03:42.260
we'll get this code snippet that essentially allows us to add this to our HD UML but because we're a

03:42.260 --> 03:49.280
javascript developers we are just going to copy this object and then we're gonna go back to our terminal

03:49.880 --> 03:54.950
and in our terminal we are going to yarn add the firebase project

03:57.750 --> 04:06.390
and once this package is loaded let's start configuring and adding firebase into our application.
