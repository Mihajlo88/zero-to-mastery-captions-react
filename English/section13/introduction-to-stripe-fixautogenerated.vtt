00:01.010 --> 00:08.640
In this section we are going to talk about building in the stripe integration so if you're unfamiliar

00:08.640 --> 00:17.760
with stripe stripe is a platform that allows us to handle online payments which doing from scratch is

00:17.850 --> 00:26.280
actually an extremely lengthy ordeal an undertaking to do not just in terms of coding the elements on

00:26.280 --> 00:34.950
the front end but also the logistics of handling payments international payments payments online taking

00:34.950 --> 00:41.970
credit cards how to properly secure and store credit card information and then actually checking against

00:41.970 --> 00:46.280
the banks and then doing a proper e-commerce flow.

00:46.380 --> 00:51.870
It's all extremely extremely lengthy and difficult for us to do.

00:52.050 --> 00:58.860
But what stripe as a platform does is it actually hides that all and handles it all for us and it gives

00:58.860 --> 01:05.840
us a very easy interface to interact with and bring into our front and applications.

01:05.890 --> 01:13.960
Now what we're using is this striped button that allows us to fire off this element where we can fill

01:13.960 --> 01:23.010
in our information right and we can provide a test credit card which we have listed here which will

01:23.010 --> 01:26.310
then handle an artificial payment

01:30.040 --> 01:30.700
right.

01:30.740 --> 01:37.370
And it's essentially all of the elements required in order to properly do payment flow on our front

01:37.370 --> 01:45.710
end now in order to actually create charges however it requires a back end server which we're not going

01:45.710 --> 01:50.950
to do in this lesson we can cover it in an advance lesson near the end of the course.

01:51.170 --> 01:57.290
But for the purposes of our project we just want to demonstrate that we have this final flow considered

01:57.620 --> 02:04.970
as well as show our ability in integrating with a service like stripe so that we understand the requirements

02:05.030 --> 02:12.970
of what it's like now if we go to the stripe Web site we'll see that its introduction is that it's the

02:12.970 --> 02:14.920
new standard for online payments.

02:15.160 --> 02:20.350
It's the best software platform for running an Internet business and they handle billions of dollars

02:20.770 --> 02:30.560
every year in terms of actually processing payments so stripe is a massive tech company and they are

02:30.620 --> 02:37.720
massively successful now in order for us to actually use it we can take a look at some of the ways that

02:37.720 --> 02:41.860
it allows us to integrate into our applications.

02:41.900 --> 02:48.380
One of them being inside of their website on their developers tab nested in the documentation is this

02:48.380 --> 02:50.780
thing called elements.

02:50.780 --> 02:56.870
Now stripe actually provides us with a lot of the elements that we might need in order to properly use

02:56.870 --> 02:58.340
their service.

02:58.370 --> 03:02.080
So we've actually seen an element with their dropdown.

03:02.120 --> 03:02.350
Right.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.520
Because we don't code this ourselves.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.740
We pretty much just get even this button.

03:06.920 --> 03:13.760
And then this button will fire off this creation of this component which we just fill out.

03:14.060 --> 03:19.100
And then it formats everything correctly based on the information provided for us to actually make a

03:19.100 --> 03:24.130
charge on their service but just to walk through.

03:24.130 --> 03:27.600
In case you're curious about all these kinds of things you can do with stripe.

03:27.670 --> 03:30.480
They have multiple ways of handling payments.

03:30.580 --> 03:35.170
They have ways where you can handle payments while building out the form yourself because they'll give

03:35.170 --> 03:37.000
you the form elements that you'll need.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.740
This includes name and email fields with this bank.

03:41.750 --> 03:47.650
No field and then they have bank drop downs which will give you an ability to select which bank you

03:47.650 --> 03:50.000
want depending on what region you're in.

03:50.140 --> 03:54.850
And usually to use these there are just the elements and then you pass a certain configurations as properties

03:56.620 --> 04:02.900
but beyond that they also have these payment style forms that we can leverage.

04:02.990 --> 04:07.910
So this is actually a more comprehensive version of those form fields put together.

04:08.270 --> 04:15.500
You can even pull in this pay now field which allows you to leverage your browser's built in payment

04:15.500 --> 04:22.850
processing system so there's a lot of options that stripe provides for us to use however we want inside

04:22.850 --> 04:24.170
of our service.

04:24.170 --> 04:27.890
But the one that we want to use is going to be this dropdown.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.130
And we're only going to build the front end of it.

04:31.160 --> 04:36.260
So we're not actually going to handle the payment until a later lesson because it requires us to actually

04:36.260 --> 04:41.480
write some back in code some note or express code and even then I'm going to minimize the amount of

04:41.480 --> 04:43.970
code that we have to write just to handle the payment.

04:43.970 --> 04:46.610
But that lesson is not entirely necessary for react.

04:46.640 --> 04:47.470
That is more so.

04:47.470 --> 04:53.660
Just if you're interested in seeing what it's like to fully flush out the flow of handling a test payment

04:53.840 --> 04:59.620
inside of your stripe account I'm gonna show you how that looks at the very end of the course.

05:00.350 --> 05:06.110
But right now for us and for our project that we want to show to potential employers we just want to

05:06.110 --> 05:12.890
show our ability to integrate with the service far off this element and then show a flow in some kind.

05:12.890 --> 05:19.980
That makes sense of a user checking out and paying with this stripe integration now before we actually

05:19.980 --> 05:21.230
begin bringing it in.

05:21.330 --> 05:27.930
We just have to make a stripe account which is free and all you have to do is go to the sign on the

05:27.990 --> 05:29.580
website and then you sign up.

05:29.580 --> 05:36.290
If you don't have one if you do just log in and once you log in I will see you in the next lesson where

05:36.290 --> 05:38.840
we bring this into our application.
