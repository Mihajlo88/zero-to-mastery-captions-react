00:00.630 --> 00:06.860
So in the last lessons we learned the two main hooks that we have access to and react now.

00:06.930 --> 00:12.880
There are other hooks of course but the two main hooks are you state and use effect.

00:12.900 --> 00:20.490
So let's use them and change our components so that we use those hooks in place of perhaps class components

00:20.490 --> 00:23.770
that can just simply be functional components.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.180
So the first one we're going to look at is our silent component.

00:27.330 --> 00:35.100
Now in this component we see that all we really do is leverage our state in order to set the values

00:35.250 --> 00:38.830
of our form so that we can fire it off.

00:38.940 --> 00:48.640
So let's change this over to using a used state hook so let's bring in our used state hook and the first

00:48.640 --> 00:51.670
thing we know that we don't need anymore is this constructor.

00:51.670 --> 00:59.960
So let's get rid of our constructor and convert our class itself into this hook as well.

01:02.640 --> 01:08.840
So of course any methods that we had on will now have to be their own methods which is perfectly fine

01:09.890 --> 01:21.550
and then we know that what we're using now is our set credentials or sorry our user credentials and

01:21.550 --> 01:31.110
set credentials which is our used state passing in let's say it was e mail which will be default empty

01:31.110 --> 01:34.810
string and password which is default empty string.

01:34.890 --> 01:40.330
So all we did here was convert r this dot state over to you state.

01:40.380 --> 01:44.190
Now we're still want to use our object because we want our method to still work.

01:45.060 --> 01:48.330
So we'll see how we can change that.

01:48.340 --> 01:53.380
Well first we know we're getting this dot email sign and no longer from props but from the props that

01:53.380 --> 01:54.440
we pass it.

01:54.640 --> 01:54.870
Right.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.560
So we don't have this stock props anymore.

01:56.560 --> 02:04.970
Instead we d structure like this and instead of state now we get email and password from user credentials

02:08.140 --> 02:13.430
and pretty much our handle submit is now up to date with what we had before now instead of Klein this

02:13.430 --> 02:17.680
dot said state we're going to call set credentials right.

02:17.750 --> 02:25.110
And we passed the object we want our state to be so as before we know the name and the value that we're

02:25.110 --> 02:31.620
getting in are going to be dynamic based on the actual form input that we're updating so all we need

02:31.620 --> 02:36.270
to do is actually very similar to when we return our reduced value.

02:36.270 --> 02:43.020
We want to spread it in all of our user credentials and then we're just going to update the value that

02:43.080 --> 02:48.960
actually needs to be changed and this will pretty much allow us to use our handle change method the

02:48.960 --> 02:54.050
way we have it as well we see that we get our Google sign and start from the Stop props.

02:54.060 --> 02:57.700
So we just make sure to restructure it when it comes in as our props.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.150
And then we remove our render

03:03.740 --> 03:11.690
and now we just update our methods so that instead of calling this dot handle submit we just call the

03:11.690 --> 03:12.680
respective method

03:16.220 --> 03:22.640
and instead of calling this dot state DOT password or this dot state DOT email we can also make sure

03:22.640 --> 03:29.140
to restructure off the appropriate values now because we know we're going to use them in these user

03:29.140 --> 03:38.260
credentials as well we can actually do this D structure a little higher right and now we'll have access

03:38.710 --> 03:41.960
inside of our return.

03:42.020 --> 03:45.320
So now if we just pass an email and password

03:48.020 --> 03:50.830
we should have actually pretty much the same component

03:53.760 --> 04:02.360
so let's test and see if this actually worked so we sign up we go back to our component and what we

04:02.360 --> 04:05.080
change was our signing component.

04:05.320 --> 04:11.240
Chain of clothes that if we hit our sign and we see we trigger a sign and start and our sign is success

04:11.250 --> 04:17.730
worth so our component is pretty well converted so there were just a couple of things to keep in mind

04:17.730 --> 04:19.810
when doing the conversion.

04:19.920 --> 04:27.560
Mainly that instead of destructing off this props we just destructor inside of our function and if she

04:27.570 --> 04:28.770
Asian right.

04:28.980 --> 04:32.450
Just like we would when we did structure any props off of a functional component.

04:33.330 --> 04:36.850
And then we structure off of our new state value.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.700
So that's pretty much it.

04:38.700 --> 04:40.590
That was our sign and component.

04:40.590 --> 04:45.720
Now let's do the same thing for our sign up component very similarly.

04:45.740 --> 04:51.730
The sign up component pretty much calls you state as we did with our sign a component.

04:51.830 --> 04:52.580
So let's bring it in

04:57.510 --> 05:07.460
and let's convert our sign up over to a functional component we can copy this object over as well

05:10.920 --> 05:12.090
and similarly right.

05:12.180 --> 05:18.330
We can pretty much call it use our credentials set user credentials because that's pretty much what

05:18.330 --> 05:18.800
they are.

05:19.530 --> 05:25.550
And then we'll just instantiate with what we had before us our state.

05:25.580 --> 05:32.990
Now if you wanted to for example just instantiate four different states for each value and have display

05:32.990 --> 05:39.420
name email password confirmed password as their own value with their own set value you can totally do

05:39.420 --> 05:39.940
that.

05:40.080 --> 05:45.570
But I prefer to keep it this way just because our method already pretty much does the same thing right.

05:46.700 --> 05:54.170
In my opinion there are less functions that we have to use or write.

05:54.280 --> 06:01.360
Now we will D structure off this from props instead of calling this stuff prompts.

06:01.530 --> 06:09.210
We will get this from user credentials and in fact we're probably going to need this in multiple places

06:09.210 --> 06:09.810
in our app

06:12.450 --> 06:19.330
and instead of calling this dot sets day we'll call set user credentials.

06:19.530 --> 06:23.000
And similarly it will spread in any user credentials.

06:25.580 --> 06:31.650
And then update the respective the correct value that we need to use it for.

06:31.860 --> 06:34.720
We don't need this from state anymore.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.240
We don't need a render anymore

06:39.950 --> 06:43.920
and we just need to make sure that we're not referencing the wrong methods.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.760
So we got to of course update these as well to their own functions whereas before they were class methods

06:53.180 --> 06:55.940
and now we can just remove this dot

07:00.490 --> 07:03.180
and that's pretty much the conversion.

07:03.250 --> 07:10.800
So if we go back to our application we can sign out again and let's sign in with the new user or sign

07:10.800 --> 07:12.090
up with the new user.

07:12.090 --> 07:15.370
So let's just say m is easy right.

07:15.570 --> 07:16.180
Easy.

07:16.350 --> 07:25.390
Email dot com just fake emails before we sign up an upstart sign of success sign and success.

07:25.400 --> 07:26.840
Our component works the same.

07:26.930 --> 07:28.940
Our sagas are still working.

07:28.940 --> 07:32.750
Everything is properly converted so that's pretty easy.

07:32.750 --> 07:39.710
With our you state hook that we just learned we're able to quickly convert our components over into

07:39.710 --> 07:45.040
these functional components that call you state instead.

07:45.170 --> 07:48.230
And it was a pretty simple change right.

07:48.230 --> 07:50.950
It wasn't that significant.

07:50.980 --> 07:57.520
Now if we need to leverage more state right we can simply just either make new states using you state

07:57.580 --> 08:00.800
or if we want to more properties we can just add them here.

08:00.880 --> 08:06.510
So all in all it was pretty easy to make this chain now and the next lesson.

08:06.510 --> 08:11.550
Let's actually see a little bit more of a complicated case in using use effect.
