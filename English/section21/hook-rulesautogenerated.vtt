Welcome back everyone.

00:01.980 --> 00:08.760
Now before we start converting our crown clothing application over to using hooks there is just one

00:08.760 --> 00:10.960
quick thing I want to mention.

00:11.220 --> 00:15.460
And this actually has to do with the rules of writing these hooks.

00:15.510 --> 00:22.920
Now as you remember from our use affect example in the last lesson we did set a default search query

00:23.040 --> 00:31.680
to Bret if for example however we had a default search where it was an empty string and we didn't want

00:31.680 --> 00:39.180
to make or fire off our use of fact hook because search query did not exist yet or at the very least

00:39.180 --> 00:46.520
it was not anything meaningful then perhaps we can think about a case where we only want a fire are

00:46.580 --> 00:53.630
a fact where we actually perform the search based on some conditional depending on the length of the

00:53.630 --> 00:55.440
search query string.

00:55.550 --> 01:06.440
Now you might imagine that if for example we say search query length is greater than zero then we actually

01:06.440 --> 01:13.920
want to use our effect if you were to write the code like this however this is actually incorrect.

01:13.980 --> 01:21.140
You will actually see that this error gets thrown in our linear will tell us that we cannot call use

01:21.140 --> 01:28.070
effect inside of a conditional they must be called at the top level of our component meaning that are

01:28.640 --> 01:36.260
actual hooks including both our set state and our use effect hook must be called at the very top of

01:36.260 --> 01:42.950
this component but also if we want to leverage a conditional we should actually put it inside of the

01:42.950 --> 01:44.220
effect.

01:44.230 --> 01:51.130
So for example what we can do with our use effect hook is add the conditional here where we actually

01:51.130 --> 02:03.300
say if search query length is greater than zero then we actually fire off the hook in itself.

02:03.350 --> 02:11.180
So this is the only case where if we ever have conditionals based on some prop or some state inside

02:11.210 --> 02:18.110
of our component where we want to conditionally fire the effect we just have to make sure that we only

02:18.110 --> 02:21.020
do it inside of the hook.

02:21.060 --> 02:26.040
Now we actually don't have an example like this inside of our application but this is a good thing to

02:26.040 --> 02:28.290
keep in mind when writing hooks.

02:28.290 --> 02:34.290
So if you want to conditionally use a hook make sure you do it inside of the hooks definition and not

02:34.740 --> 02:39.170
wrapping the actual hook itself inside of a conditional.

02:39.450 --> 02:43.860
It's just a quick rule and you can actually see it in this link that I'll provide and your resources

02:43.950 --> 02:51.500
about hook rules but this is pretty much the main rule about how to conditionally call your use a fact

02:51.510 --> 02:51.720
hook.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.440
So with that in mind let's move on with our course.
