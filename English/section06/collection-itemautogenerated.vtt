00:00.810 --> 00:08.340
OK so now that we have our collection preview we need to start looking at building our menu item component

00:09.120 --> 00:20.670
so we know that our menu item component is going to consist of a image as well as a title a price.

00:20.670 --> 00:24.740
And this button that allows us to add it to the cart.

00:24.780 --> 00:29.890
Now we're not going to actually add any of the functionality in just yet.

00:29.970 --> 00:33.440
We haven't really considered how to handle our cart yet.

00:33.750 --> 00:37.700
But let's just build out this component first.

00:37.950 --> 00:47.070
So let's add in a collection item into our components and in our folder we're going to do the same thing

00:47.070 --> 00:57.150
we've been doing our collection item dot component DHS X and then our collection item dot styles thought

00:57.600 --> 00:59.310
SPSS.

00:59.310 --> 01:03.310
The more you type this the better you'll get at it.

01:03.720 --> 01:10.710
Which is always what's really interesting is that at first it always seems a little repetitive but you

01:10.710 --> 01:16.950
actually find that you really do end up remembering everything and what their purpose is.

01:16.950 --> 01:23.480
The more you practice typing the same folder structure for your components and what to do with them.

01:23.490 --> 01:24.390
OK.

01:24.480 --> 01:31.680
So now for our collection item we know that we need certain things to come in and it's a popular menu

01:31.680 --> 01:33.690
item but we don't need any state.

01:33.690 --> 01:43.950
So let's make a another Functional Component so cost collection item is equal to this functional component

01:45.530 --> 01:57.950
returns this div with our class name collection item and then we're gonna give it a div and now that

01:57.950 --> 02:01.100
div is going to hold our image.

02:01.250 --> 02:04.450
So let's just give it the class name of image for now.

02:06.150 --> 02:12.870
And let's do the same thing we did before with our directory items.

02:12.870 --> 02:21.520
So instead we know that what we're going to pass in will be an I.D. We will also get our name.

02:21.760 --> 02:30.360
We will get our price and our image URL and we have all these when we brought in that data earlier in

02:30.450 --> 02:36.860
our collection or sorry in our shop page right in our shop data specifically.

02:36.990 --> 02:41.440
So we need an I.D. name image URL and price.

02:41.950 --> 02:44.350
Now we are going to

02:46.780 --> 02:54.490
put in what we did before with our style and we are going to do background image goes to our string

02:54.490 --> 02:59.240
interpolation value of image.

02:59.370 --> 03:07.190
You are so nothing new here just yet and then we're going to add another div.

03:07.630 --> 03:10.430
And here we're going to add our collection footer

03:13.130 --> 03:18.720
inside of our footer we have is this double repeat.

03:18.830 --> 03:21.140
Actually we don't even need this closing tag.

03:21.500 --> 03:35.900
We are going to bring in our span which will be our name as well as our price awesome.

03:36.140 --> 03:36.960
OK.

03:37.280 --> 03:44.860
Now let's export this out and let's bring in the styles that we have for this component.

03:44.890 --> 03:49.900
So I've written them already for us but we can take a quick look at what they are

03:53.280 --> 03:54.920
inside of our collection item.

03:55.140 --> 03:59.590
We are styling our image so that its height is ninety five percent.

04:00.030 --> 04:06.420
Now that means that our collection photos height will be 5 percent of the total height of our collection

04:06.420 --> 04:09.540
item which will be 350 pixels.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.550
So this is pretty much going to be the layout for our actual component.

04:13.550 --> 04:22.630
What we see here so one important thing to note is that this flex column on our collection item will

04:22.720 --> 04:30.480
essentially allow our footer and our image to sit in a vertical alignment right and then our collection

04:30.480 --> 04:33.390
footer is just our regular display flex.

04:33.390 --> 04:40.680
And then we have some space between them so that our content gets pushed apart our title takes up 90

04:40.680 --> 04:46.350
percent of the space in our total footer and then the price is going to be 10 percent.

04:46.380 --> 04:52.650
So because our price is probably never going to grow that large we've got to make sure to have our name

04:52.680 --> 04:57.500
take up the majority of the space here OK.

04:57.660 --> 05:09.970
Now if we import in our collection item to our collection preview so that we can access the new collection

05:10.030 --> 05:10.930
item we wrote

05:15.420 --> 05:25.020
we can now instead of doing this div just map it through like so and because we need the properties

05:25.050 --> 05:26.990
on the item that we had before.

05:27.000 --> 05:35.180
We're just going to do what we did earlier and we're gonna do structure off our I.D. but we're also

05:35.180 --> 05:41.500
going to g structure the rest of our item props and pass that through.

05:41.600 --> 05:46.580
Like so let's do other item props.

05:49.790 --> 06:00.780
And now it's no longer a div we'll just make sure to restructure or spread our other item props into

06:00.780 --> 06:01.260
our collection.

06:01.260 --> 06:14.570
Item Oh we also have the star collection preview so those stylings is down here.

06:14.750 --> 06:15.790
OK.

06:15.840 --> 06:16.410
There we go.

06:17.380 --> 06:21.790
So we have our price and we have our thing because there's no styling coming through.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.450
Let's just inspect quickly and see if we're missing something.

06:25.450 --> 06:31.420
So while you code you might see this happen you just want to make sure that our naming is correct for

06:31.420 --> 06:31.920
everything.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.400
And we're getting the styles.

06:33.940 --> 06:43.790
So I don't see the stars that we wrote being applied here although we are getting the actual image right

06:43.790 --> 06:56.870
here being rendered so Oh I see our collection preview our collection item oh we didn't save now we

06:56.880 --> 06:59.570
go silly mistakes.

06:59.880 --> 07:08.430
So sometimes if you just take a look inside of your dev tools it's very easy to see where perhaps we

07:08.430 --> 07:15.330
are going wrong because we know for sure due to the way that react is set up everything should be in

07:15.330 --> 07:16.470
at a specific time.

07:16.470 --> 07:21.440
So if it's not being loaded then we probably messed up our import right.

07:21.690 --> 07:22.920
Which we checked first.

07:22.920 --> 07:23.250
Right.

07:23.250 --> 07:28.770
We made sure that we're importing we're in the right collection item which we were and then we checked

07:28.830 --> 07:37.810
if we had our naming like our class names correct which we did so then it just turned out we didn't

07:37.810 --> 07:38.200
save it.

07:38.230 --> 07:41.600
So it's a silly error but there are tons of those.

07:41.620 --> 07:47.230
As you become a professional developer a lot of times you'll find that you are just banging your head

07:47.230 --> 07:52.870
against the wall for 30 minutes only to find out that you had a slight typo.

07:52.870 --> 07:53.950
It's very common.

07:54.700 --> 08:02.500
But just like that we now have our collection component so the only thing we're missing is the hover

08:02.500 --> 08:04.220
effect with the add button.

08:04.300 --> 08:11.170
But we can add that in a little later when we actually build out our cart because that's what that feature

08:11.230 --> 08:12.870
will be tied to.

08:12.970 --> 08:20.650
And one more thing before we commit our code we should add a little bit of padding on our overall project

08:21.160 --> 08:24.620
so that it aligns closer to this.

08:24.640 --> 08:34.330
So let's go into our app Dot's RSS and let's do padding 20 pixels and 80 pixels.

08:34.330 --> 08:38.480
So I want 20 pixels on the top and bottom and then 80 pixels on the side.

08:38.530 --> 08:45.240
And now it looks closer so this may be a little bit more than what we had.

08:45.240 --> 08:48.080
So let's actually make this 60 pixels.

08:48.090 --> 08:48.600
Maybe

08:52.350 --> 08:53.230
it's a little better.

08:53.250 --> 08:53.800
That's pretty good.

08:54.540 --> 08:56.100
So now let's commit our code.

08:56.100 --> 09:02.540
Let's go back to our terminal let's do a get add.

09:02.630 --> 09:02.930
All right.

09:02.930 --> 09:04.780
Let's see what we first have to commit.

09:05.060 --> 09:06.150
OK.

09:06.290 --> 09:20.640
And then let's do get commit updating our app with a shop page collection preview component and collection

09:20.760 --> 09:21.840
item component.

09:23.130 --> 09:28.800
And now let's just get push origin master OK.

09:28.950 --> 09:29.940
Our code is up.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.020
Now let's move on.
