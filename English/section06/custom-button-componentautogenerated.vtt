00:01.200 --> 00:11.000
Now that we have our form input component we also want a button component that's custom this button

00:11.060 --> 00:17.030
is also going to be a presentational component similar to our form input.

00:17.030 --> 00:24.980
And the reason why we're building them as their own component is so that this component can be used

00:25.220 --> 00:33.530
in any other component that might need consistent input styling that we have across our application.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.590
So what do I mean by this.

00:35.600 --> 00:44.300
Well up till this point we've pretty much limited all of our styling for our titles and our menu items

00:44.870 --> 00:54.510
and our collection items all in this or whichever respective component that they're in.

00:54.510 --> 01:00.330
So any styling for the home page sits in the home page style store SAS fun.

01:00.510 --> 01:09.350
But now we're running into components that we know are going to be reused across the application so

01:09.350 --> 01:15.110
if we look at our final application we see that we're going to use the button in our sign and we're

01:15.110 --> 01:17.410
gonna use the button in our sign up.

01:17.630 --> 01:22.370
And we're also going to use our form input across both the sign and the sign up.

01:22.370 --> 01:29.420
So limiting our form input styles to just the signing would cause us to have to repeat that same style

01:29.420 --> 01:34.620
code inside of our sign up as well but we don't want to do that.

01:34.670 --> 01:42.140
We want to make components that we can reuse across our application and even our button is used in more

01:42.140 --> 01:44.170
than just our sign and page.

01:44.240 --> 01:51.760
We know it's going to be used inside of our checkout and we see that this is actually inverse.

01:51.860 --> 01:57.320
So it's going to have to be a pretty flexible button including in our shop we use something similar

01:57.320 --> 02:01.900
as well so how are we going to build this.

02:01.900 --> 02:11.500
Well first let's just start with building our signing button for our sign and Page will add the functionality

02:11.680 --> 02:13.210
as we require it.

02:13.240 --> 02:20.470
Because this way it allows us to re-evaluate and properly consider the tradeoffs of how we should build

02:20.620 --> 02:31.060
our button so let's go back to our component and let's add in this new custom button component

02:34.460 --> 02:47.730
and let's just make custom button dock component Dutch ASX and custom button dot styles dot SAS will

02:47.820 --> 02:53.890
import react from react or import in our style sheet

02:57.140 --> 03:04.490
and then we're just going to export a stateless Functional Component called custom button

03:08.240 --> 03:11.180
and it's just going to render a button component

03:14.930 --> 03:24.810
and then we're going to attach the styling to our custom button class name you might wonder if this

03:24.810 --> 03:32.910
is a button but in our actual sign in component we were using an input to do our H terminals form submission

03:34.000 --> 03:37.270
how would it continue to work if we switched it to a button.

03:37.270 --> 03:44.410
Well for both button and input they can both take this property of type submit and they can both submit

03:44.530 --> 03:52.930
the form that they're in they'll both trigger when clicked if the other types submit the on submit method

03:53.200 --> 03:54.940
on our form.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.740
So what we want to do is we want to be able to pass that in.

03:58.740 --> 04:05.790
So what we'll do is we'll first pull the children off of our props that get passed into our custom button

04:06.540 --> 04:13.740
and then we're gonna d structure all the other prompts into this other props property and spread that

04:14.520 --> 04:19.830
into our custom button.

04:19.840 --> 04:26.680
Now if we have a type submit being passed into custom button the button will get that and then we'll

04:26.680 --> 04:37.840
put children inside of our button component and now if we export our custom button and then we add in

04:37.840 --> 04:42.190
our custom button styles which I have provided right here

04:45.960 --> 04:50.670
we can now import our custom button into our component

04:55.320 --> 04:57.310
and replace this input with it.

05:01.390 --> 05:10.510
Now instead of doing a value here because we have children we're just going to put sign in like so and

05:10.510 --> 05:18.290
now we have our button there is a little bit of styling we need to add to our sign and component itself.

05:19.750 --> 05:32.290
And what we will do is we will go to our sign in styles and we're just going to add a display flex a

05:32.370 --> 05:40.050
flex direction of column because we want all of our elements inside of our sign and to sit vertically

05:42.230 --> 05:46.940
and then we're also going to add a bit of a margin between our title.

05:46.970 --> 05:59.040
So we're gonna put margin of 10 pixels on the top in the bottom and now we have air our assignment component.

05:59.040 --> 06:06.610
So next we're gonna start integrating with Firebase and that is gonna be a really exciting lesson.
