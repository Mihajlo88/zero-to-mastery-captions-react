00:00.970 --> 00:08.110
Now in the last lesson we created our Remove button with our X icon winking.

00:08.140 --> 00:16.220
Now we actually need to create the functionality in our redux code in order to clear this item out now.

00:16.220 --> 00:23.480
This is actually going to be very similar to what we did from a redux standpoint.

00:23.690 --> 00:30.200
As far as when we added items and you can imagine it must be similar because what we're doing is we're

00:30.200 --> 00:40.490
trying to update our cart items reducer value inside of our cart reducer so that we clear out an item

00:40.580 --> 00:42.550
regardless of its quantity.

00:42.590 --> 00:50.870
When ever we hit this x button so of course we now know that we need to dispatch a new action that will

00:50.870 --> 00:59.240
clear out that item based on an item that we pass in as the payload for this new action that we're trying

00:59.240 --> 01:03.690
to write so let's actually do this.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.570
Now we already know what we need to do from a redux standpoint.

01:08.700 --> 01:15.060
We need to first make the new action type so inside of our car types.

01:15.060 --> 01:23.760
Let's make a new one called Clear item from cart which is equal to the string value of clear item from

01:23.760 --> 01:25.390
cart.

01:25.400 --> 01:33.810
Now what we want to do with the actual action is we want to make a new action that dispatches the new

01:33.960 --> 01:35.790
cleared him from cart that we just made.

01:36.570 --> 01:42.790
So we will call it clear item from car as well which gets an item.

01:42.810 --> 01:46.830
So it's a function that gets an item as a property just like our add item.

01:47.250 --> 01:54.280
And in exactly similar way as our add item action creator we're going to set the type equal to our new

01:54.280 --> 02:02.390
clear item from cart and set the payload equal to the item that we're trying to clear now that we have

02:02.390 --> 02:10.640
this we need to actually update our reducer so that our reducer removes the appropriate item from the

02:10.640 --> 02:19.730
array so inside of our cart reducer we're going to make a new case that will listen to our new action

02:21.060 --> 02:23.560
so this will be our car action type stuff.

02:23.560 --> 02:32.190
Clear item from cart and what it will return is going to be a new object where we spread everything

02:32.190 --> 02:41.900
in our state but we also want to update our cart items so that now it will return a new array with out

02:42.290 --> 02:47.730
any instance of that item that we're trying to clear away.

02:47.810 --> 02:55.090
Now the code that we need to right here in our reducer is going to be a filter if you remember from

02:55.090 --> 03:05.240
filter we're just going to call on our existing car items array that exists on our state right now and

03:05.240 --> 03:09.750
we're going to filter it passing in the appropriate car.

03:09.760 --> 03:20.360
Item and then what we'll say is that if the cart item I.D. does not match the action payload which we

03:20.360 --> 03:25.710
know is the item we're trying to remove I.D. then I want you to keep it.

03:26.070 --> 03:32.790
If that car item I.D. does match the items I.D. that we're trying to remove from our payload then I

03:32.790 --> 03:33.770
want you to filter it out.

03:34.470 --> 03:43.110
Now as you remember filter returns us back anything that yields true inside of the actual function as

03:43.110 --> 03:49.880
the return of the function here what it's saying is that if the car items I.D. does not match the item

03:49.880 --> 03:52.400
we're trying to filter then return true.

03:52.400 --> 03:58.310
So we'll keep that item right because we want to keep any item where the idea is not the one that we're

03:58.310 --> 03:59.510
trying to clear up.

03:59.600 --> 04:05.190
So that's what filter does and it gives us back a new array with this.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.390
We've made our clear item from cart.

04:07.600 --> 04:12.160
We just need to now bind it to our checkout item component.

04:12.250 --> 04:20.220
So what we're going to do is inside of our checkout item component we are going to now import interconnect

04:20.710 --> 04:31.220
because we need to use we need to bind our actual new action to our component very similar to how we

04:31.220 --> 04:43.350
did it with ADD item so we'll just import that in as clear item from cart from our redux folder cart

04:43.720 --> 04:54.300
cart action then we need to make our map dispatch to props which is equal to this function that gets

04:54.300 --> 05:06.720
dispatch from the redux store and then we will return our new clear item and with this clear item function

05:07.620 --> 05:13.480
we are going to set it to pretty much what we had earlier with our ad item.

05:13.500 --> 05:20.150
The only difference is that now we're using our new clear item for cart function.

05:20.340 --> 05:27.790
So we'll make sure to dispatch clear item from cart passing in our item as you see this shape is very

05:27.790 --> 05:32.860
similar to the code that we wrote inside of our collection item.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.550
When we map dispatch our an item.

05:35.540 --> 05:45.310
Function and then we just have to make sure to connect passing info and our map dispatch to props

05:48.330 --> 05:49.470
wrapping our checkout.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.560
Item.

05:51.650 --> 05:54.860
So now we need the cart item.

05:54.860 --> 06:01.650
So instead of destruction these values off here remember by doing this and destruction these values

06:01.740 --> 06:03.600
this way one layer deep.

06:03.600 --> 06:09.090
So we're pulling cart item off the props object and then pulling these values off of the cart item.

06:09.090 --> 06:12.970
We actually don't have access to the car item property.

06:13.080 --> 06:21.090
So what we need to do is we need to again do an explicit return in this function and just make sure

06:21.090 --> 06:29.760
to set the concept of these values inside of the squiggly lines of our function definition and now we'll

06:29.760 --> 06:37.340
have access to our cart item as well as our new clear item function that we're passing in.

06:37.400 --> 06:45.230
So now on our Remove button we can do our on click where we create a new anonymous function that will

06:45.230 --> 06:52.250
call our new clear item function that we're passing in as a prop and we'll pass the cart item in like

06:52.250 --> 06:58.120
so and now we have our clear item working.

06:58.120 --> 07:04.360
So this is very similar to our ad item functionality that we wrote a couple lessons ago except now the

07:04.420 --> 07:11.930
main difference is that our reducer changes its functionality instead of doing our ad item to cart.

07:12.040 --> 07:20.860
We're doing this new filter which returns us a new array with the appropriate item filtered out.

07:20.930 --> 07:25.550
Now if we go back to our application we go back to our shop.

07:25.780 --> 07:32.780
We add some items and let's say I wanted to get rid of brown cowboy if I hit the x.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.850
We see that it got removed.

07:34.850 --> 07:38.150
We see our clear item from car action being fired.

07:38.390 --> 07:46.580
And of course we see our cart cart items array reflecting the new changes and just like that we've now

07:46.580 --> 07:51.780
built in our clear item from cart feature that was actually pretty simple.

07:51.830 --> 07:59.000
It's pretty much just the same pattern that we were used to from writing our ad item feature and you'll

07:59.000 --> 08:04.370
see that much of redux is pretty much just this pattern that we've written twice now.

08:04.370 --> 08:13.580
We mainly want to do something with our reducer passing in some specific object as a payload maybe not

08:13.580 --> 08:14.290
even an object.

08:14.300 --> 08:19.400
Maybe it's some property and what we do is we just want to update our reducer.

08:19.400 --> 08:26.060
So we want to update our state values accordingly depending on what we're getting we'll actually see

08:26.060 --> 08:34.390
this in bit more detail once we add in our arrows and we reuse our add item as well as make a new remove

08:34.460 --> 08:40.490
item feature inside of our checkout item we'll do that in the next lesson.
