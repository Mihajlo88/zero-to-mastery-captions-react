00:01.160 --> 00:05.410
Now what we need to build next is our checkout page.

00:05.420 --> 00:10.780
We have to start styling it and also creating the checkout items.

00:10.880 --> 00:17.690
Now looking at the final products for our checkout page we see that there will be a total some checkout

00:17.690 --> 00:18.590
items.

00:18.590 --> 00:25.300
This header as well as this section here that has to do with payment with stripe.

00:25.360 --> 00:30.740
Now we'll take this one part of the time and let's actually build our base page first.

00:30.760 --> 00:38.710
So let's have this total and then let's have this header as well as the checkout items which we'll tackle

00:38.800 --> 00:40.080
after.

00:40.230 --> 00:43.880
So let's just first build the checkout page.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.190
Now what we know that we need from the checkout page will be the header first.

00:49.270 --> 00:52.720
So let's just build that out now.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.160
I already have the styles for you but we'll explore a little bit after we set up the base HD Himmel

01:00.170 --> 01:02.830
elements for this.

01:02.850 --> 01:11.690
We need a class name of checkout page and inside of our checkout page will be our checkout header

01:14.320 --> 01:22.480
so it will just be a div that hold some of these block like elements together and these block elements

01:22.540 --> 01:24.160
are called header blocks

01:27.650 --> 01:35.570
and inside of them is a span that has some text regarding what it will say and it will be respectively.

01:35.630 --> 01:39.920
Product Description Quantity Price and remove.

01:39.920 --> 01:49.570
So let's copy this over actually four more times for each block and this one will say Product

01:52.710 --> 01:53.400
Description

01:59.350 --> 01:59.770
Oh sorry.

01:59.780 --> 02:00.680
This is quantity

02:05.610 --> 02:06.900
and finally remove

02:11.380 --> 02:13.170
for the actual styling.

02:13.210 --> 02:18.600
I have them as normal so you can just paste them into your style sheet.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.190
And let's take a quick look at what we're doing here.

02:21.210 --> 02:28.260
The main thing to focus on is that our checkout header is 100 percent of the page and the page itself

02:28.350 --> 02:32.700
is fifty five percent of the total that is available to it.

02:33.450 --> 02:40.830
So for us that's why it's centered in this quantity amount and it's responsive accordingly but each

02:40.890 --> 02:48.300
header block inside of our header is twenty three percent of the total width except for the last child

02:48.360 --> 02:54.420
which is our last header block which is 8 percent so twenty three times four is ninety two plus eight

02:54.450 --> 03:01.200
gives us a hundred and the reason for this is because our remove only holds the X button so it doesn't

03:01.200 --> 03:06.330
need as much space as the other header blocks inside of our header.

03:06.330 --> 03:13.200
But now that we have our header component let's actually bring in our cart items from our state and

03:13.200 --> 03:16.080
then we'll build our checkout item and finish this page.

03:16.140 --> 03:20.310
So let's just first bring in all the things that we need.

03:20.430 --> 03:26.630
So we need connect from reactor redux.

03:26.680 --> 03:34.580
We also need create structured selector from re selected because we know we're gonna be pulling some

03:34.580 --> 03:44.030
stuff off the state and then we're going to bring in our actual select cart items from redux

03:46.760 --> 03:51.620
parts selectors and we'll pull off select cart items

03:55.400 --> 04:05.090
now let's write our map states props maps state props which will be our create structured selector and

04:05.090 --> 04:12.350
we'll pass it in as carte items GOES TO SELECT CARD items now as far as the total goes.

04:12.410 --> 04:20.640
We need another selector for it that will add all of the price of our items together that selector.

04:20.690 --> 04:31.230
We will add to our cart selector and we'll say we'll call it expert contest select cart total.

04:31.870 --> 04:33.880
Yeah like our total.

04:33.880 --> 04:34.770
That sounds pretty good.

04:37.160 --> 04:43.520
And what we'll need is we'll need all of our car items and it's going to be very similar to our reduce

04:44.360 --> 04:46.430
the previous one we had four items count.

04:46.430 --> 04:52.780
The only difference is that we're going to be accumulating the value of the price of the card at a plot

04:52.790 --> 05:00.230
price times the item quantity so we can actually copy this over and just modify it so

05:03.040 --> 05:07.140
because the main thing we're trying to get is the total cost right.

05:07.150 --> 05:10.910
And we know the cost of each item and we know how many of each item we have.

05:11.020 --> 05:16.840
So it's pretty much just going to be the quantity multiplied by the price.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.410
So now let's bring this into our component

05:24.720 --> 05:34.410
and then we'll say the total value is this and then let's connect it together and we'll add our maps

05:34.410 --> 05:35.380
stage props

05:38.880 --> 05:44.090
and then D structure off both the car items that were passing in now as well as the total

05:46.890 --> 05:57.530
and now what we can do right after our header component is we can put a quick little map right of our

05:57.530 --> 05:58.370
car items

06:01.340 --> 06:04.010
and we'll just show the name for now before we build our component.

06:04.370 --> 06:09.770
But let's just make sure that the parts that we can control for now are working and we just want to

06:09.770 --> 06:20.270
render a car item Donny and then after this we're gonna have a div that has the class name of total

06:22.760 --> 06:25.220
and inside will be the span

06:28.090 --> 06:39.370
that has our total and now we save and if we look we'll see that because we have no items right.

06:39.430 --> 06:43.270
Our total is zero but once we add our items in

06:47.580 --> 06:52.530
we'll see that our total is updating and there's the name of our items cool.

06:52.650 --> 06:58.650
So nothing new nothing really that different from what we've done so far but now we have our checkout

06:58.650 --> 06:59.850
page.

06:59.850 --> 07:01.260
So let's build our checkout item.
