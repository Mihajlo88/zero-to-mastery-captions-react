Hello It's Andre here again.

1
00:04.320 --> 00:09.930
I want you to notice what Yihua has been doing so far and he's going to continue to do throughout

2
00:09.930 --> 00:14.670
the course that is he's writing extensible code.

3
00:14.730 --> 00:21.090
Are you starting to feel like we're doing a lot of things over and over the same way we're creating

4
00:21.090 --> 00:29.550
reduced hours and actions and selectors and connecting components and rendering components and if things

5
00:29.550 --> 00:31.450
seem repetitive to you.

6
00:31.620 --> 00:40.830
That's actually a good thing because what we're doing is we're making things very simple now we're creating

7
00:40.830 --> 00:48.930
a lot of files in our project but these files are all usually under one hundred lines of code each file

8
00:48.930 --> 00:52.200
is very very simple isn't it.

9
00:52.240 --> 00:56.950
We haven't been any crazy long thousand line algorithms.

10
00:56.950 --> 01:00.220
Everything is nice small and simple.

11
01:00.220 --> 01:09.100
And if you notice each one makes each component very very small and also very extensible that is he

12
01:09.160 --> 01:17.650
reuses components and features across the application so that he's not constantly doing the same thing

13
01:17.680 --> 01:26.710
over and over it's OK if we're copying code that is well similar in let's say a selector or using map

14
01:26.710 --> 01:29.170
state to props over and over.

15
01:29.200 --> 01:36.250
The idea is that he's structured the project in such a way that your eye could come to the project and

16
01:36.250 --> 01:43.620
really easily add features really easily add a custom button or a cart item.

17
01:44.050 --> 01:51.430
And this is a sign of a really good developer because when he's coding He's coding for the future as

18
01:51.430 --> 01:51.980
well.

19
01:52.060 --> 01:58.360
He knows that by thinking a little bit about how to make the code more extensible in the future he'll

20
01:58.360 --> 02:04.570
benefit as he takes on more and more features because he can use the same functionality in one part

21
02:04.570 --> 02:12.400
of the app in another part of the app and react and Redux really allows us to create extensible code

22
02:13.440 --> 02:17.660
and the other word that you might be thinking of is also predictable code.

23
02:17.760 --> 02:20.700
There's nothing hard about what we're doing right now.

24
02:20.700 --> 02:27.360
Everything is super easy and predictable at least it is once you get used to the react redux syntax.

25
02:27.360 --> 02:33.840
But at the end of the day we're just creating really declarative code really predictable pure functions

26
02:34.350 --> 02:42.120
that can be extended so keep an eye on that throughout the course because this is why you want to do.

27
02:42.300 --> 02:48.780
You don't want to make code that makes you look impressive or clever or tough you want code so simple

28
02:48.900 --> 02:52.080
that anybody can read it let's keep going.
