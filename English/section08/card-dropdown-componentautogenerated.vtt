00:00.620 --> 00:06.890
Now that we have our car icon component let's start building our car dropdown.

00:06.920 --> 00:11.750
So if we look at our dropdown we know that there is a container.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.930
There is this section with items inside that a scroll level.

00:16.010 --> 00:25.610
And there's also a go to checkout button and it opens and is seemingly stuck to that area just underneath

00:25.790 --> 00:27.920
our cart icon.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.740
So let's start building this component.

00:31.780 --> 00:39.940
The first thing we're going to do is we are going to create a cart component here.

00:39.980 --> 00:48.920
We'll just call it cart and inside of it actually let's call it cart dropdown.

00:48.950 --> 00:53.060
It's a bit more direct about what it is.

00:53.130 --> 01:01.980
So we're going to create our cart dropdown component Dutch assets as well as our cart dropdown dot styles

01:02.010 --> 01:08.440
DOT says we are gonna import react from react.

01:08.700 --> 01:14.370
And we're also going to import in our custom button because we know we need one at the very end

01:20.090 --> 01:32.370
or import in our style sheet and what we're going to use for our component is a regular stateless component

01:33.870 --> 01:48.920
and inside will be a containing do with the class name of cart dropdown and also this div that has the

01:48.920 --> 01:56.090
class name of our cart items because this will be the thing that contains our cart items which will

01:56.090 --> 02:00.830
keep empty for now and then our custom button

02:03.790 --> 02:19.440
and we will say go to checkout on the inside and here we will export t fault our cart dropdown cart

02:19.800 --> 02:23.360
dropped it.

02:23.420 --> 02:36.470
Now let's bring in our style sheet so I have the styles here for you as well for this component and

02:36.560 --> 02:42.600
I'm pushing the margin top of auto for our button so that it's always at the bottom.

02:42.890 --> 02:51.690
The car items takes up 240 pixels it aligns everything inside so that it flows vertically and it has

02:51.690 --> 02:56.350
an oversight flow of scroll but we won't create car items just yet.

02:56.670 --> 03:05.420
We have to bring our cart dropdown into our header component and we got to import in our cart dropdown

03:05.420 --> 03:05.900
component

03:10.240 --> 03:19.350
cart dropdown cart dropdown component and we're going to place it just outside of our options div because

03:19.410 --> 03:24.570
we want it to sit just outside of that div.

03:25.320 --> 03:32.190
So now if we go back to our application we'll see it right there awesome.

03:32.930 --> 03:41.750
OK now what we have to do is conditionally show or hide this card dropdown and to do so we are going

03:41.750 --> 03:52.840
to trigger something that will show or hide this component based off of some true or false value.

03:52.850 --> 03:59.810
Now we are going to create a cart reducer to do this and we're going to set the value of some property

04:00.050 --> 04:08.390
probably called Hidden on that reducer based on clicking this icon because maybe there are other ways

04:08.390 --> 04:15.050
that we want to hide this in the future we don't know but what we do want to do is we want to keep that

04:15.080 --> 04:23.150
in our global state in case anywhere else wants to trigger the ability to hide or show our dropdown.

04:23.150 --> 04:24.440
So let's implement that.
