00:00.150 --> 00:08.490
So now that we have our car icon component and our cart dropdown component we have to figure out how

00:08.490 --> 00:16.770
to trigger our cart dropdown to hide and show based off clicking the cart icon.

00:16.800 --> 00:24.300
Now you might be wondering if we could just find that functionality into our head our component because

00:24.300 --> 00:31.200
both these components are here and using our local component state we could possibly add an on click

00:31.200 --> 00:38.880
handler here that updates a state value on our header that sets it to true or false.

00:38.910 --> 00:43.930
And then based off of that true false value we just hide or show this car dropdown.

00:43.980 --> 00:51.600
And that would be entirely valid if we were certain that the only way we wanted to hide or show our

00:51.600 --> 00:54.940
car dropdown was within our head our component.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.300
But because we are not sure of that.

00:57.450 --> 01:04.020
Perhaps we want to show or hide our car dropdown in another component.

01:04.020 --> 01:11.580
We want to move that functionality and that capability outside of the header component and inside of

01:11.580 --> 01:14.420
our global redux state.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.130
Now how do we do that.

01:16.130 --> 01:23.090
Well first let's create the redux files and they'll look very similar to our user files.

01:23.090 --> 01:27.880
So instead of user or call it cart we'll make a cart.

01:27.920 --> 01:36.220
Actions that J us a cart dot reducer dodgy us and a cart dot type stuff.

01:36.230 --> 01:43.200
J ust now starting with our reducer we know that we need an initial state

01:46.950 --> 01:53.920
where the hidden value is true because we want to hide our dropdown when they first comes to our Web

01:53.920 --> 02:04.840
site then we're going to have our cart reducer equal to a function where state is equal to our initial

02:04.840 --> 02:05.400
state.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.060
If no value comes in.

02:07.060 --> 02:15.730
So default value of initial state and then our action and using a switch statement on the action date

02:15.790 --> 02:29.060
type we will now selectively render with a case of let's say toggle cart hidden.

02:29.240 --> 02:38.510
The reason why we want to use a toggle versus a set is because our cart component will either be in

02:38.510 --> 02:39.620
a true or false state.

02:39.650 --> 02:42.780
So it's either hidden or not hidden right.

02:42.860 --> 02:47.420
And we know that we're mainly switching it back and forth between true and false.

02:47.420 --> 02:56.000
So instead of passing in a value for our actions our payload what we can actually do is we can say hidden

02:56.120 --> 02:59.240
is equal to state to hit it.

02:59.900 --> 03:05.930
So that exclamation mark is saying that whatever this boolean value is I want you to convert it to the

03:06.050 --> 03:07.360
opposite of it.

03:07.400 --> 03:07.700
Right.

03:07.700 --> 03:15.520
So if it's true or to be false if it's false I want it to be true and then by default we want to return

03:15.790 --> 03:19.110
just the state.

03:19.150 --> 03:23.980
Now this of course is a string but we want to make an action type for it.

03:24.040 --> 03:28.120
So let's go to our car dot actions and let's export default

03:30.750 --> 03:39.270
heart action types where toggle card hidden goes to the string toggle car hidden.

03:39.270 --> 03:45.280
And now we just need to import that from our car types

03:48.510 --> 03:50.970
and it will be cart action types

03:55.260 --> 04:03.130
toggle card hidden and we'll export out our reducer as the default.

04:03.150 --> 04:05.190
So now we have our code

04:09.000 --> 04:23.180
oh maybe I got to move this down here sometimes our lender yells at us now to make the actual oh wait

04:23.510 --> 04:24.020
i move it.

04:24.140 --> 04:32.100
Oh sorry I put this in the wrong file cart types my that wrong file that all that that's definitely

04:32.100 --> 04:35.260
confusing the file the file naming conventions.

04:35.470 --> 04:39.180
It's a thing that always used to throw me off when I was first learning read.

04:39.170 --> 04:39.360
OK.

04:39.370 --> 04:43.790
So definitely don't feel bad because we all make these mistakes.

04:43.980 --> 04:48.560
Now the cart action we actually need to make the action now.

04:48.590 --> 05:00.450
So let's import in our car action types from car types and what our value will be.

05:00.670 --> 05:06.460
We will set it as X export concert toggle cart.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.930
Hidden is equal to a function.

05:10.230 --> 05:13.280
And we're not going to pass a payload because we don't need one.

05:13.330 --> 05:16.640
We're just going to set type equal to cart action types.

05:18.990 --> 05:27.530
Dot toggle cart hit in payload is actually an optional property on our action object and inside of a

05:27.530 --> 05:32.800
reducer we're not actually using the payload inside of this respective case.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.160
Right.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.960
So there's no need for us to pass a payload.

05:36.260 --> 05:40.980
We just need to know that if it's of this type we're just going to switch it from whatever its previous

05:40.980 --> 05:48.970
state was to its opposite state and now inside of cart icon.

05:49.290 --> 05:58.890
Let's find that action here so let's import connect from react redux.

05:59.030 --> 06:01.300
Let's bring in our action type

06:09.180 --> 06:10.090
part action.

06:12.870 --> 06:24.540
Toggle car hit an and we need our map dispatch to props which gets a dispatch and we're gonna call it

06:24.570 --> 06:34.050
toggle cart hidden will just be a function that triggers the dispatch of toggle cart hit.

06:35.750 --> 06:39.190
And now we'll pass this into our connect function.

06:41.900 --> 06:53.110
Passing know as the default so now we'll be able to access toggle cart hit in here and we can just find

06:53.110 --> 07:06.250
it on click like so and now if we look we'll see that we fire the action now of course our state is

07:06.280 --> 07:16.360
updating oh we actually have to add our cart reducer to our route reducer so that's a step that we always

07:16.360 --> 07:24.390
got to remember so cart reducer from our cart cart producer.

07:26.580 --> 07:34.110
This is another common mistake that we make when we first start using redux as well as that we'll forget

07:34.530 --> 07:39.530
to port and add our cart to our cart reducer.

07:39.540 --> 07:46.940
So now if we look we'll see that our cart by default is hit and true if we click it we'll see that now

07:46.940 --> 07:48.380
it's false.

07:48.380 --> 07:53.320
So now we just have to hide and show this dropdown based off of that value.

07:53.570 --> 08:02.380
So let's go back to our header component and we'll impart in O where we have our maps data props.

08:02.870 --> 08:08.090
So what we need to do structure off of our state is also now the cart and then the hidden value.

08:08.660 --> 08:16.040
So I'm actually going to show you more advanced way to D structure as well so off of our state we want

08:16.040 --> 08:20.040
the user and off the user we want the current user.

08:20.600 --> 08:26.210
So this is the syntax you write when you want to d structure nested values.

08:26.210 --> 08:26.540
Right.

08:26.540 --> 08:34.160
So by going colon and then another D structure bracket we're saying I want you to give me this value

08:34.240 --> 08:37.850
off of the user which is being destructor off of the state.

08:37.940 --> 08:47.660
So similarly we will do that off of the cart and we want to hit in value and then instead of this we

08:47.660 --> 09:02.920
can now just do that and now pull the hidden value off and we can just selectively render this based

09:03.010 --> 09:06.370
off of a ternary operator.

09:06.400 --> 09:13.450
So if it's hidden if it is true then I want to render nothing but if it's not then render the cart dropdown

09:13.450 --> 09:14.680
component.

09:14.680 --> 09:25.700
And now if we look we can see that we can toggle our dropdown now before we add our add item feature

09:25.700 --> 09:32.110
to our cart and to our application let's commit our code.

09:32.370 --> 09:47.590
We know that what we are adding is our cart icon added cart icon and cart dropdown components to our

09:47.710 --> 09:55.060
application also implemented heart reducer

09:58.060 --> 10:01.690
and then let's push and continue with our had item.
