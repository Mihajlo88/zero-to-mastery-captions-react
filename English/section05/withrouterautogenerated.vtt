00:01.860 --> 00:09.630
We just learn how to navigate throughout our application using the link component and the history property

00:09.690 --> 00:12.750
that we get from RAC router Dom.

00:12.750 --> 00:19.500
Now how would we actually go about setting up our menu item so that it allows us to navigate to different

00:19.500 --> 00:20.770
pages.

00:20.790 --> 00:28.100
More specifically we want to use our hearts menu item to navigate to our new hearts page.

00:28.130 --> 00:36.800
Well one of the caveats of using those properties that we get from root which is the match the history

00:36.830 --> 00:45.140
and the location property is that we actually only get access to them from the first component that

00:45.140 --> 00:47.930
gets passed into our route.

00:47.930 --> 00:58.340
So even though directory and menu item are children of our home page component only our home page component

00:58.340 --> 01:04.340
gets access to the history prop that we need because it's the home page component that we're passing

01:04.340 --> 01:07.100
into root so root only passes it.

01:07.130 --> 01:10.010
One child in which is its child.

01:10.010 --> 01:17.700
So our homepage one solution we could do is we can pass these props down into our directory.

01:17.850 --> 01:26.250
We could pass the history into our directory and then we can pass that history from our directory down

01:26.250 --> 01:27.210
into our menu item

01:30.130 --> 01:32.420
this stop prop start history.

01:32.770 --> 01:39.180
And by doing so our menu item now has access to the history in its props.

01:39.180 --> 01:48.050
The problem with doing it this way is that this is actually a bad pattern called Prop tunnelling because

01:48.060 --> 01:55.220
work tunneling these props multiple children deep in order to get them to the component that needs them.

01:55.220 --> 02:03.770
But the children in between don't actually need the history property for any reason other than to pass

02:03.770 --> 02:04.570
it to their children.

02:06.090 --> 02:13.050
Now luckily there is a solution that RAC router Dom provides us that allows us to not have to do this

02:14.260 --> 02:15.940
so let's take a look.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.650
So first let's undo

02:20.220 --> 02:24.130
prop tunneling code that we just wrote.

02:24.350 --> 02:25.830
We don't need that either.

02:27.160 --> 02:34.890
And what we're gonna use is actually a another component from react router Dom.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.470
And this component is called with the router

02:43.870 --> 02:52.270
now what with router is is it's a higher order component and a higher order component is essentially

02:52.330 --> 03:00.200
a function that takes a component as an argument and which turns you a modified component.

03:00.340 --> 03:09.160
So just like how our menu item is a function that takes props and renders out a component a higher order

03:09.160 --> 03:17.200
component is a function that takes any component and modifies it in some way and then returns you that

03:17.200 --> 03:19.630
new modified component.

03:19.630 --> 03:26.680
So it's kind of like a function that gives you back a powered up component.

03:26.680 --> 03:35.230
In this case where POWERING UP OUR MENU ITEM component to have access to those things related to our

03:35.230 --> 03:36.620
router.

03:36.870 --> 03:42.990
So what we would do is we just pass are not history.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.320
We just pass our menu item component into this.

03:46.320 --> 03:54.040
With router and with router will then return us back with the same name of this menu item right.

03:54.100 --> 03:54.590
What we're.

03:54.610 --> 04:02.050
Whatever it is that we're explaining by default it will return us back a super powered menu item component

04:02.710 --> 04:10.780
with access now to those location match and history prompts that we need access to.

04:11.530 --> 04:15.100
So by wrapping now we now have access to history

04:18.380 --> 04:27.520
and what we want to do with history is we want to wrap our whole div items so that on click we're gonna

04:27.530 --> 04:35.290
push history not push to some euro.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.780
Now how do we do this.

04:37.800 --> 04:45.810
Well what we want to be able to do is have these you are all ideas almost beat dynamically generated

04:45.810 --> 04:54.410
as well because we know that where we're going is going to be the hearts page so we know that our route

04:54.410 --> 04:56.530
needs a Hasbro right.

04:56.570 --> 05:10.740
So what we can do for now just a hardcoded is we can go into our directory component and add a You are

05:10.740 --> 05:13.690
all parameter here like a link of sorts right.

05:13.690 --> 05:24.100
Link you URL and we're just going to set this to hearts so after this we want to add the same value

05:24.160 --> 05:26.040
but to every other section.

05:26.560 --> 05:34.690
But for now we'll just keep it as an empty string because we don't actually have those other routes

05:34.690 --> 05:35.470
set up yet.

05:37.540 --> 05:40.800
Now we're going to pass this link url into our menu item.

05:41.980 --> 05:49.330
And it is on our section right that we're mapping through but because we're at we're getting more and

05:49.330 --> 05:58.250
more verbose it's very easy for us to just do this again link you URL and then to pass it in as Link

05:58.340 --> 06:04.770
URL but you'll notice that these keys that we're de structuring off are essentially equivalent to the

06:04.770 --> 06:11.160
exact same property name that we're also passing in to our menu item.

06:11.190 --> 06:20.700
So there's actually a little yes 6 trick we can do by spreading the rest of these values together that

06:20.700 --> 06:31.310
we don't need for key because I.D. We're not actually passing an I.D. we can remove that and then set

06:31.310 --> 06:41.650
the rest of them as section prompt or other section prompts and now we can spread those values in like

06:41.650 --> 06:42.850
this.

06:43.150 --> 06:49.510
And this is equivalent to us writing out what we did before by spreading these values through.

06:49.540 --> 06:56.470
We're saying that every other key value pair we want to pass in where the key of title goes to the value

06:56.530 --> 06:57.710
of men's.

06:57.730 --> 07:01.450
So this is equivalent to us having done that

07:04.720 --> 07:17.330
and now in our menu item we will have access to the link to Earl which we now want to push however we

07:17.450 --> 07:23.810
also don't know in our menu item where in our directory we will be.

07:23.810 --> 07:28.100
So what we can do is we can take the match

07:30.900 --> 07:37.950
as well and just like in our demonstration earlier we can do match.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.650
Got you Earl in to

07:44.400 --> 07:52.940
link you Earl and now if we save this we should see if we click our hearts page.

07:52.940 --> 07:59.690
It navigates us to our hearts page and if we were to change our you URL at any point our component is

07:59.690 --> 08:07.370
still fully aware and functional because it knows that it's just going to base where it's been matched

08:07.370 --> 08:12.200
up to and then append the euro.

08:12.220 --> 08:20.760
And with that we have some basic navigation setup inside of our menu item component.

08:20.800 --> 08:30.760
So now with this in mind let's commit our code so let's see what we have to commit so we have to now

08:32.020 --> 08:39.210
update our menu items to navigate

08:42.390 --> 08:46.500
router HFC.

08:46.510 --> 08:51.100
Now we're going to explore this concept of higher order component further.

08:51.100 --> 08:59.000
A little later when we write our own but for now just remember our higher order component is just a

08:59.000 --> 09:09.140
function that takes another component as an argument transforms it into another component and returns

09:09.140 --> 09:16.360
that transformed component out of itself so we'll definitely explore that further.

09:16.460 --> 09:19.770
But for now just think about it simply like that.

09:19.850 --> 09:26.160
So let's get push origin master our code and let's move on to the next lesson.
