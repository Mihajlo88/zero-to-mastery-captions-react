00:00.970 --> 00:05.930
Now before we do reduce let's do find.

00:06.170 --> 00:09.400
So what is fined.

00:09.430 --> 00:12.600
Well let's first get our array again.

00:13.060 --> 00:22.900
So we'll just copy over what we had from our last experiment and find is also exactly as it sounds.

00:23.010 --> 00:33.490
We're trying to find an element that correctly returns true based on the conditional that we have and

00:33.700 --> 00:38.320
the return of our function very similar to filter.

00:38.320 --> 00:47.660
So what we would say is my array doesn't find and we would get our element and let's say I wanted the

00:47.720 --> 00:51.050
element that is equal to five.

00:51.950 --> 00:55.400
Well here it would it would get us our element five.

00:55.460 --> 00:55.780
Right.

00:55.790 --> 00:58.800
Because if one goes in is it equals a five.

00:58.800 --> 01:02.510
No 3 No but 5 is true.

01:02.510 --> 01:09.260
And the moment that it's correct this method actually stops and it gives us back the first value in

01:09.260 --> 01:16.600
the array that return True from calling this function on each element.

01:16.640 --> 01:26.600
So it won't keep going so away we can actually see this is if we say my array find and we get our element

01:27.920 --> 01:37.680
and let's say we do as long as the element is greater than four so theoretically five seven and nine

01:37.770 --> 01:45.510
are all true but because it's applying it from left to right on each element the first element that

01:45.510 --> 01:50.400
This returns true it will return and it won't keep going.

01:50.400 --> 01:58.760
And we know that it will be five so dot find is a great way for us when world well let's say we have

01:58.760 --> 02:00.800
an array of objects.

02:00.800 --> 02:01.300
Right.

02:01.370 --> 02:05.490
And we want to find a specific object based on some condition.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.500
Right.

02:06.590 --> 02:16.700
You can imagine if we had let's say people array where we had an array of objects where the I.D. was

02:16.700 --> 02:28.410
one the I.D. of four and then the I.D. of seven.

02:28.870 --> 02:39.370
If we wanted to find people array right with the idea for one then we would say a person or person I.D.

02:39.760 --> 02:49.150
was equal to four and now this will give us our second item where it's our person with our idea for.

02:49.180 --> 02:52.090
So this is the great thing about find is that final.

02:52.090 --> 02:58.990
Give us the reference to whatever element it is that matches the condition that we pass in the function

02:59.530 --> 03:05.590
of our find and we will use this as well quite extensively in our coding.
