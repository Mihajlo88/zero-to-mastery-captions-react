Now the next one we're going to look at is filter so to understand filter let's go back to our browser

00:10.660 --> 00:22.040
console so filter is very similar to map in the sense that it's also going to take a function that gets

00:22.130 --> 00:25.070
iterated over each element in our array.

00:25.580 --> 00:38.750
So let's do this again except this time I'm going to say my array is equal to 1 3 5 7 9 now.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.500
Filter is exactly as it sounds.

00:41.750 --> 00:51.520
We want to filter out the elements in our array based off of the function that we pass it and filter

00:51.580 --> 00:58.260
will also give us back a new array instead of modifying my array.

00:58.340 --> 01:06.250
So what we're gonna do in order to use filter is we're going to write dot filter and just like earlier

01:06.280 --> 01:12.820
with DOT math we're gonna get the element as the argument over function and what we're going to return

01:12.880 --> 01:17.110
is actually a true or false value.

01:17.350 --> 01:24.280
So let's say for example I wanted to filter out anything that was less than five.

01:24.320 --> 01:36.980
Well I would essentially say if the element is greater than four right so whatever returns true will

01:36.980 --> 01:40.940
be the thing that gets kept in our array.

01:40.970 --> 01:47.660
So whatever element we'll get kept in our array is based on whether or not the evaluation of this is

01:47.660 --> 01:48.940
true.

01:48.950 --> 01:53.970
So if for example we just return true Well we would get back our whole array.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.850
If we return false.

01:55.850 --> 01:56.530
Right.

01:56.870 --> 02:06.710
We would get back nothing so if we wanted just whatever was five or greater then we would say as long

02:06.710 --> 02:16.530
as the element is greater than four because if the element is one one is not greater than four.

02:16.530 --> 02:17.310
Right.

02:17.370 --> 02:26.720
So that will be false and that's why it'll filter out 1 and 3 and this array that we get back is a new

02:26.720 --> 02:34.720
array my array is still the same array and that's what filter is.

02:34.740 --> 02:45.570
So remember that filter also returns back a new array except it filters out the anything where the function

02:45.870 --> 02:49.770
condition returns false.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.970
Anything that returns true it'll keep in the new array.
