00:01.470 --> 00:08.120
In this video we're going to talk about get and get hub and source control.

00:08.160 --> 00:13.530
Now you might remember get hub from our previous section where we used it to put the Web site online

00:14.340 --> 00:17.820
but I'll show you that it is so much more than that.

00:18.000 --> 00:24.690
More importantly getting get hub is used by most professional companies and it is a skill that is expected

00:24.690 --> 00:26.700
to be known by all developers now.

00:27.330 --> 00:33.460
So this is an important section one of the first things most developers have to do on their first day

00:33.460 --> 00:40.030
at the job is to MIT something called a pull request which uses get and get help.

00:40.270 --> 00:41.380
We'll get through that.

00:41.380 --> 00:47.580
In this section don't worry you're going to learn all of this and it's going to make sense.

00:47.590 --> 00:49.600
Let's first start with source control.

00:49.630 --> 00:53.180
Up until now we have only worked on small files.

00:53.260 --> 00:56.260
No team members just ourselves.

00:56.260 --> 00:58.470
Just a couple of files.

00:58.660 --> 01:02.410
But in real life you're most likely not the only developer on a team.

01:03.370 --> 01:04.900
Most likely the projects are huge.

01:04.900 --> 01:07.060
There's many many files.

01:07.060 --> 01:12.670
Source control allows us to make sure that multiple people can work on the same file from different

01:12.670 --> 01:14.320
locations.

01:14.350 --> 01:22.480
Think of it as Google Docs that allows people to collaborate on one document but enough talk let's actually

01:22.540 --> 01:23.470
check it out.

01:23.470 --> 01:27.410
I have over here set up two folders.

01:27.580 --> 01:28.720
One is for myself.

01:28.750 --> 01:36.580
Andre who just started a new job but X company and I have MRC here who has been working at the company

01:36.580 --> 01:40.750
for a while and she has project files over here.

01:40.750 --> 01:46.540
I'm actually using the files from our background generator video now without get or get help.

01:46.540 --> 01:53.830
What I can do is just copy and paste these files so I have whatever Marcy has and we can start working

01:53.830 --> 01:54.860
on these files.

01:54.910 --> 02:02.470
I can have my developer environment here with my terminal and my Sublime Text and I can work on whatever

02:02.470 --> 02:09.560
changes that need to be made on the app and Marci over here also has her own version where she can work

02:09.560 --> 02:16.520
on it and we're both working on the same project but let's say that both Marcy and I are working on

02:16.520 --> 02:23.510
this project and she decides to change the project name from gradient background to super background

02:24.650 --> 02:30.680
and at the same time in my project I decide to call this cool background.

02:31.440 --> 02:39.740
Well now you'll have to set up a meeting between myself and Marcy and decide how we should change the

02:39.740 --> 02:40.880
code.

02:41.180 --> 02:46.490
And this is a small example but you can imagine that as different programmers work together there's

02:46.490 --> 02:50.710
always going to be this issue of one person changing one thing and another prison changing.

02:50.750 --> 02:51.590
Another thing.

02:51.590 --> 02:59.510
This is where source control came in and social control is a way to control this where we have one place

02:59.540 --> 03:02.260
instead of our own computers.

03:02.330 --> 03:09.350
And this case is just represented by the folder that I have in here instead of each of us having a copy

03:09.350 --> 03:12.480
of the project with source control.

03:12.560 --> 03:19.370
We have a copy of the project but there is a centralized location up somewhere maybe owned by the company

03:19.370 --> 03:26.960
or somewhere on the Internet that has the ultimate version that we each talk to to make sure that we

03:26.960 --> 03:35.390
each have the same version getting get hub is a way to do this to be able to use source control and

03:35.540 --> 03:38.870
as a matter of fact it's the de facto way of doing this.

03:38.870 --> 03:44.540
So like I said before this is most likely the tool you'll be using every single day at your workplace

03:46.190 --> 03:54.140
so if I go to the github Web site here what it allows us to do is it's a place a central place that

03:54.140 --> 04:04.360
both Andre and Marcy can talk to so even though we work on the same files the same project I can ask

04:04.450 --> 04:07.650
this central location such as GetUp.

04:07.750 --> 04:11.150
Hey has Marcy made any changes.

04:11.410 --> 04:18.590
And Marcy can ask hey has Andre made any changes and every once in a while you'll get something like

04:18.590 --> 04:25.490
this where we have cool background and super background where we have something called a merge conflict

04:26.420 --> 04:34.250
what get Hub allows us to do is say hey I noticed there is a merge conflict I see that you guys have

04:34.250 --> 04:38.850
both changed your background I don't know who's right but here's the information.

04:39.620 --> 04:43.840
Andre Marcy Can you guys talk amongst yourself and figure it out.

04:45.150 --> 04:46.130
That's pretty much workflow.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.710
So let's actually see what this looks like.

04:50.020 --> 04:53.230
The first thing we want to do is set up a github account.

04:53.620 --> 04:59.340
If you haven't done it in the previous exercises you absolutely should start to get hub account.

04:59.350 --> 05:00.640
It's free.

05:00.640 --> 05:06.220
And like I said before if you're a developer you just need to have it it's where everybody puts their

05:06.220 --> 05:11.110
projects it's where you work you'll be spending a lot of time on this Web site.

05:12.680 --> 05:18.500
You might remember that when we had the get Hub project I also told you to get get hub for desktop

05:21.330 --> 05:23.570
although we use that to make things simpler.

05:23.570 --> 05:27.480
During that video this is actually not the recommended way of doing it.

05:27.510 --> 05:34.620
It allows you to visually see and interact with get hub but it's kind of looked down upon by employers

05:34.620 --> 05:39.360
and most people use the terminal or the command prompt to actually do it.

05:39.380 --> 05:44.730
So I won't be teaching you this way just because I think it's bad practice and getting used to the terminal

05:44.820 --> 05:46.440
is important.

05:46.440 --> 05:51.460
I'm going to close that and we're gonna get the start the very first thing we're gonna do is we're going

05:51.460 --> 05:58.910
to click on Start a project and here we're going to call it whatever you want we'll call it background

06:00.140 --> 06:07.280
generator and you also want to leave it as public and we want to click on initialize this with a read

06:07.280 --> 06:09.580
me and we'll click Create repository.

06:10.010 --> 06:10.880
And what that does.

06:10.910 --> 06:18.200
Well we've created a new project on GitHub and here the read me which is just a file that describes

06:18.260 --> 06:18.950
your project.

06:18.950 --> 06:20.350
You can see that it's here.

06:20.690 --> 06:24.320
We can type into the read me whatever we want and I'll describe our project.

06:25.190 --> 06:29.420
But let's go back if Marcy.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.320
Let's say Marcy has been working at this company for a long time.

06:32.330 --> 06:36.420
I'm actually gonna remove my files here.

06:36.820 --> 06:42.700
Marcy has been working at this company for a long time and the employer finally decided hey we need

06:42.700 --> 06:43.630
to use get hub.

06:43.630 --> 06:46.420
We're going to hire this new guy Andre.

06:46.420 --> 06:51.210
We want to make sure that you both can work on it on the project together without any issues.

06:51.220 --> 06:59.740
Can you put the project up on github so what Marcy will do is she will go to get help create background

06:59.740 --> 07:05.320
generator and then she's going to click right over here to clone or download and she's going to make

07:05.320 --> 07:12.880
sure it says use HDD P.S. And from here you just click on this button which copies this link to your

07:12.880 --> 07:19.520
keyboard then Marcy goes to her terminal.

07:19.780 --> 07:27.160
And right now we're in documents we want to have the project in the Marcy folder so I'll C.D. into Marcy

07:27.730 --> 07:31.120
if I click Elyse I see that yet I have my files.

07:31.120 --> 07:42.440
Now the first command that we're going to learn is called Get clone and then copy and paste what we

07:42.440 --> 07:43.770
copy from the Web site.

07:43.820 --> 07:49.540
We're just saying hey clone this project from get hub dot com.

07:49.820 --> 07:53.000
So I press enter and there you go.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.890
Everything is downloaded.

07:55.310 --> 08:00.080
If I go back to the folder now I see that I have a background generator.

08:00.070 --> 08:04.970
If I double click this you'll see that I have a dot get folder here that's actually hidden.

08:04.970 --> 08:10.070
You might not even see it on your laptop if you don't have this feature on your computer enabled but

08:10.070 --> 08:14.700
this dog get now allows me to communicate with GetUp.

08:15.050 --> 08:16.270
So what we can do now.

08:16.280 --> 08:23.840
Marcy can copy and paste these files and put it into the background generator.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.680
Now let me show you the next get command.

08:26.720 --> 08:33.020
Marcy right now if we see she's in her folder but now we need to go into background generator because

08:33.050 --> 08:36.030
if we do any gate commands here.

08:36.350 --> 08:39.740
Well it won't work because it's not a good project.

08:39.740 --> 08:43.560
We need to actually go inside of the project that was created on github.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.820
So I'm going to S.D. into that directory notice here.

08:46.820 --> 08:53.150
I have my terminal set so that it actually shows me what get hub location I'm in and I'll explain one

08:53.150 --> 08:58.600
master means later now that we're here we can look at all our files.

08:58.620 --> 09:04.810
Yep I see that now I have my read me which I created on GitHub plus the files that I copy and pasting

09:06.650 --> 09:14.250
we need to sync this so that if I go into my background generator instead of the read me files Marcy

09:14.270 --> 09:26.300
can put up her files on GitHub the way we do that is our second command get status it tells us that

09:27.200 --> 09:34.870
we have on tracked files that is we have indexed not a Schimmel script yes and style that are on tract

09:35.330 --> 09:39.740
and it says use get ad file to include while you will be committed.

09:40.430 --> 09:48.680
So now that we see our status of what we have in our folder we can say get ad and the file name so I

09:48.680 --> 10:02.560
can do index dot paste email get had script digest and get ad style that CSX.

10:03.950 --> 10:06.410
Let's clear this so we can see it.

10:06.530 --> 10:11.420
And now I can do get status again just to see what our status is.

10:11.420 --> 10:16.630
And now I have your branches up to date changes to be committed.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.290
You see that now with ad we've said hey we want to add these changes.

10:21.410 --> 10:27.050
We have new files that we've added and says to be committed.

10:27.050 --> 10:35.630
So the second step is to do something called Get commit and get commit says hey I'm committing that

10:35.630 --> 10:39.630
these are the changes that I want to make to get hub.

10:39.830 --> 10:44.040
And it allows you to pass a message so that on get happy it'll show the message.

10:44.150 --> 10:50.300
When Andre comes back in he can say oh Marcy added these files and this is the message and we do that

10:50.300 --> 10:52.710
by doing this.

10:52.820 --> 11:03.110
And within here within the double codes I can say adding starting Project close the bracket press Enter

11:04.460 --> 11:05.810
I'm going to clear this.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.430
Now there's one last step.

11:07.610 --> 11:09.070
We've added.

11:09.380 --> 11:16.490
We did get add to add our changes then get commit to commit and say yeah we're locking in those changes.

11:16.490 --> 11:22.540
And then finally we need to let get hub dot com know that these are the changes.

11:22.550 --> 11:25.130
So we do get push

11:28.400 --> 11:29.690
and there you go.

11:29.690 --> 11:33.440
It has now been pushed to this repository.

11:33.440 --> 11:41.700
So if I go back and I refresh look at that it's the same thing that we did when we put up our first

11:41.700 --> 11:42.930
Web site online.

11:43.050 --> 11:49.230
But instead of using the desktop version of Get hub we use the command line and now we have our project

11:49.530 --> 11:51.800
which is very good.

11:51.810 --> 11:53.530
Now let's go back to our example.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.830
So Marcy has been working on this project.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.540
There's a good repository.

11:57.540 --> 12:02.990
And I just joined the company and now I need to start working on this.

12:03.150 --> 12:10.350
What do I do now I need to access GitHub and get the copy of background generator the way I do that.

12:10.380 --> 12:11.820
Well I go into my folder

12:15.540 --> 12:23.910
and I do the same thing I do get clone and then I copy and paste the repository just like before

12:26.820 --> 12:30.280
get clone and clone the repo.

12:30.510 --> 12:31.400
And there you go.

12:31.500 --> 12:38.960
If I go back to my folder look at that I have a background generator so we're both working now on background

12:38.960 --> 12:45.940
generator but not off of each other's files we're working with whatever version is on github.

12:46.890 --> 12:47.220
All right.

12:47.220 --> 12:55.320
So now more realistic we go back to working and on the first day of my job I say I'm going to change

12:55.320 --> 12:57.140
the greenish background title.

12:57.210 --> 13:06.360
Actually the h1 tag to cool generator if I save this and I do get status

13:09.720 --> 13:18.050
Oh well I'm not in a good repository right now if you remember I have to go into background generator.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.090
Let me open that up a bit so you can see.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.800
There you go again.

13:22.880 --> 13:27.950
These get commands won't work if you're not in a folder that has the dot get folder.

13:28.400 --> 13:32.150
So let me do that C.D. into background generator.

13:32.390 --> 13:37.970
I'm going to clear this and I'm going to say get status and look at that.

13:38.000 --> 13:46.340
It tells me that I've modified index not ACM Alpha and if you remember I will say Get had I only have

13:46.340 --> 13:51.440
one file I can do it next dot A.T.M. but if I want it if I had multiple files and I want to just commit

13:51.440 --> 13:59.330
all them on once I can just do the period so I'll do that and then get commit and I'll add a message

13:59.990 --> 14:06.030
changing Title I press enter.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.930
Now clear this.

14:08.010 --> 14:08.290
OK.

14:08.310 --> 14:15.720
And again I do get push and it looks like everything went through.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.360
So let's open that up and check it out.

14:18.380 --> 14:19.610
I now refresh here

14:22.890 --> 14:30.350
and what we haven't seen any changes but we now see that we have three commits.

14:30.510 --> 14:36.120
We have the initial commit the adding back project that MRC did.

14:36.120 --> 14:44.550
And it shows you all the files that were added and if I go back I have the changing title commit and

14:44.550 --> 14:46.680
now I see that yeah.

14:46.860 --> 14:51.750
Andre just changed the background generator which is in red too.

14:51.810 --> 14:54.600
Cool generator.

14:54.700 --> 15:00.130
So as you can see we have a history of all the changes and we can always go back if there's any mistakes

15:00.730 --> 15:03.570
but there's one issue right now.

15:03.730 --> 15:13.580
If I go back to the code and I go to Marcy's computer I see that well she still has a background generator

15:14.050 --> 15:15.040
here.

15:15.110 --> 15:16.070
Why is that.

15:16.070 --> 15:19.190
Well because her computer doesn't know that.

15:19.190 --> 15:21.350
Get hub has been updated.

15:21.350 --> 15:28.070
The next command I'm going to show you this is the last one I'm going to show you in this video is get

15:28.210 --> 15:29.150
pull.

15:29.330 --> 15:38.480
So remember get push to push the changes to get Hongkong and get pull to pull Whatever's the latest.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.470
So I do get pull.

15:41.720 --> 15:42.250
And there you go.

15:42.680 --> 15:48.400
You see over here that it shows me that index that Asian mail file was was changed.

15:48.410 --> 15:54.420
Now you see that my title has been changed to cool generator.

15:54.490 --> 16:00.090
Let's just say that Marcy saw my first change and she really really likes how I've added cool generator.

16:00.220 --> 16:03.880
But I think she wants to make it capitalized again.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.740
She's going to save that.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.900
She's going to say get status.

16:09.100 --> 16:09.380
All right.

16:09.400 --> 16:16.900
I have my index that a simple file get and then get commit.

16:16.900 --> 16:29.490
And off the message cap a two lies title and then get push.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.050
There you go again.

16:31.250 --> 16:37.410
I go back I refresh and now there's four commits.

16:37.460 --> 16:44.470
And we see that capitalized title is the new changes the first day of work is done.

16:44.870 --> 16:53.280
I come into the next day of work and while I want to start with whatever the latest project is of back

16:53.270 --> 16:59.810
on generator let's say Marcy worked all night to change that title to cool capitalized I want to make

16:59.810 --> 17:02.030
sure that I have the most updated version.

17:02.180 --> 17:07.660
So what I do is when I get into work in the morning I'll say well I want to make sure that if there's

17:07.670 --> 17:14.150
any changes that Marcy made I know about then so I'm going to say get pull and notice here how the titles
